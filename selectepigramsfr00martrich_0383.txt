6. lupo. 11. 37. 4. From this it would appear that olives

7. nec tibi, Aac. ‘Be not surm-ised, that my muse, conscious
of the mediocrity of her poet, should shrink from your criti-
cism, of which even Nero stood in awe.’

9. Nero. Nero's conceit would be proof against much,
therefore, if he feared Nerva’s criticism, how much more must
an ordinary poet fear it ἱ) Martial probably means neither to
praise, or to disparage Nero as a poet. An he means is, that
if an emperor-poet shrank from Nerva’s criticism, he (Martial)
might very well do so.

On Nero’s poems, cf. Suet. Nero, c. 52, ‘Itaque ad poeticam
pronus, carmina libenter ac sine labore composuit, nec, ut quidam
putant, aliena pro suis edidit?

As to Nerva, Martial vm. 70. 7, calls him ‘nostri temporis
Tibullum Carmina qui docti nota Neronis habet.’

self, that his body would be torn by dogs. Suet. Domit. c. 15.
