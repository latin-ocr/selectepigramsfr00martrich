NOTES. VI. lxiv. 28—1xxv. 4. 305

28. fumantem :iram spirantem. Martial represents his
critic as a cur attacking a bear. He advises him to be content
with a bear-skin to worry and not to provoke a live bear, how-
ever tame he may seem.

32. tacitam=lifeless‚ but with a reference to Martial him-
self, who could take vengeance with his tongue.

LXV. On a critic Tucca, perhaps the one attacked in the
preceding, who Martia] knows will find fault with the previous
ἒέῗέῗεω, because it is long, and because it is written in Hexa-

2. denique. ‘Secondly and last1y3' firom being used to
introduce the last and most important statement in a series,
denique came to be used as here, without any such series, to
add an emphatic or conclusive statement to a single preceding
statement. Thus often it means ‘in a word‚’ comprising the
foregoing statement in a higher or more general one, and
implying that nothing can be added to increase the force of the
expressmn.

6. transire. ‘To skip) The couplet is a contemptuous
expression of Martial’s indifference to Tucca's criticism.

LXXV. An epigram throwing a curious light on the preva-
lence of poisoning in Rome. Martia] treats this woman as a
recognised adept in the art. On the whole subject see Mr
Mayor's note on J nv, 1. 70, where all the authorities are quoted.
Compare also Martial IV. 69, addressed to Papilus, and telling
him practically that he was commonly believed to have made
away with four wives by poison, Diceris hac factus caelebs
quater esse layona. Nec puto nec credo, Papile, nec sitio. ‘ Of
course I don’t believe such stories, but Ι will not drink your
wme.’

1. turdum. Prop., the fieldfare, used for game generally.

placentae. A large flat, thin cake, made of flour, obesse,
and honey: when baked, it was cut into equares.

3. buccellas. Lit. ‘little mouthfuls.’ So ‘tit-bits,’ ‘dainties’
tuas. ‘From you.’

Pontia. A fictitious name, evidently, formed from Pontus,
whose inhabitants were famous in antiquity for their skffl in
the use of poisons.

4. has ego, &a ‘1 will not send them on to my friends
(cf. Hor. Sat. 11. v. 10) but I will not eat them myself either.'

M. 20
