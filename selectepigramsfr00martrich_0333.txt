shoulders of young and strong slaves attracts men’s notice as
ἒέἕξᾶῃῖε a dwarf on a tiny mule, or a negro on a dusky

Atlas. Cf. J uv. v111. 32, a common nickname of dwarfs.

9. invidiosa. ‘Do you ask what offence your letter gives?’
Invidiosus is often used of that which raises a feeling in
people’s minds against a person.

10. non debes. Two statements condensed into one, ‘As
a poor man you have no business to ride on men's shoulders,
except as a corpse being carried to burial, and then you ought
to be carried on a sandapila, the bier used for the poorer
classes, and not on a lecticas

hexaphoro‚ i.e. a large lectica requiring six hearers. The
octophoron required eight.

LXXX. ‘ On the custom of importing roses in winter from
Egypt, now rendered useless by the growth of them artificially
in Rome,’ Paley and Stone3 and so also Becker, Gallus p. 364.
But whether roses were so imported or not, and very likely they
may have been,<there is nothing in this epigram implying such
importation, and the idea that the subject of it is the cessation
of such importation is incompatible with the sense of the first
four lines. What Martia] says is that a present of roses in
winter had been sent to the emperor from Egypt, the person or
persons sending it thinking that such a present would be a
novelty in Rome. But when the person who brought the
present entered Rome, he found to his surprise that winter
roses were quite common there. Accordingly Martial recom-
mends Egypt, now that it has discovered this (jam), to import
roses from Rome in winter. On forced roses and the late crops
of Paestum see Becker l.c. ⁷

2. ambitiosa.. ‘By way of showing off her powers,’ for
this sense of ambitiosus, ‘ostentatious,' cf. Tac. Germ. c. 27,
Funerum nulla ambitio.

3. Pharios. Cf. IV. 11. 4.

8. tonsfflbus. There seems to be no means of determining
exactly the meaning of this epithet‚ probably it means no more
than ‘made of cut roses’ Some commentatore understand
chaplets, otherwise called sutiles, made of single leaves stripped
off, and sown on to bast (philyra). Becker, Gallus p. 491.

omne iter. Does this mean that they were exposed for sale
in shops and by hawkers?
