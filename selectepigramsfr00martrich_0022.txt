definite conception of the epigram and to that concep-
tion adhered rigidly.'’ Hence, over and above their
historical, social, and antiquarian interest, Martial’s
epigrams have a real literary interest as the pro-
ductions of the first master of one branch of litera-
ture, an interest entirely wanting in most of his
poetic contemporaries. No one for example would
read the epics of Statius⁵²‚ if he could avoid it;
no one would read his Sylvae except for the historical
information to be obtained from them. But with
Martial the case is different. He hae, indeed, fur-
nished us with full and varied information, most
valuable for understanding the society in which he
lived (more valuable, we venture to think, because on
some points more trustwcrthy than the information
afforded by Juvenal), and the historian or antiquarian
may read him for that information. But the general
reader and the literary reader will read him as an
author, properly so called, as the writer who has
matured a literary type. Any one who wishes to
know what the epigram is, in all its various phases,
or who wishes to write epigrams himself, must go to
Martial for the information that he requires.

been admirably explained by Lessing. He shows the
essential connexion existing between the fully de-

52 Martial and Statius, though they had many common
friends, and must have been constantly coming across one
another, never mention one another by name. They probably
had nothing in common, and as they were rival candidates for
popular support neither perhaps thought he could afford to
praise the other. Indirectly they attacked one another. Martial
no doubt was in Statius's mind when he talked of his enviers

and detractore, and it seems more than probable that Statius
was the gentleman we know of (quidam, nt. 97) who was

bursting with envy at Martial's popularity. See Friedl. 111. 348.
