here surely means portable ovens or hot water cans, on which the
pieman kept the sausages hot as he hawked them about the
streets. If it means the shops, it must be the dative case,
‘carries round the pot houses. ' It is true that popinae were for-
bidden by several emperors to sell any food except certain vege-
tables, Suet. Tib. c. 34 3 Nero c. 16; Dio Cassius 66. 10; but it is
equally certain that the restriction was generally disregarded,
J ων. xl. 81, so that there would be no necessity for such a man as
the one described here, in the popinae themselves. This is
evidently aman who hawks his viands about the streets, calling
them as he goes,

11. non optimus. ‘An inferior Urbicus?

Urbicus (JuV. VI. 71), was apparently a writer and actor of
fabulae Atellanae, fames, in which the wit was of the broadest
kind, and the jokes stock jokes Others read urbicus and render
‘an inferior city poet:’ that is, a street ballad singer or perhaps
‘improvisatore.' All the vocations mentioned above would give
full scope to a power of rough and ready repartee and a wit of

Gabbam, JuV. V. 4, vilis Gabba, and Mart. X. 101, where

Trajan) to the advantage of the latter. He was apparently scurra
or court J'ester to Augustus. Friedlander‚ 1. 145.

16. Tettius caballus, evidently a scurra or wit, but nothing
is known about him.

17. culcunque ‘anyone' used simply asan indefinite demon-
strative pronoun. Gomp. ubicunque in 1. 2. 1; v111. 48. 5.

nasum. ‘Critical taste’ cf. ‘nasum rhinocerotis‚’ 1. 3. 6.
nasus is used absolutely here in a sense acquired from its use
in such expressions as those quoted in note on that passage.

non est. If (e. g.) Sydney Smith's name had been Hack
instead of Smith, the sarcasm of the text would have been
exactly represented by saying of a would-be wit and loud vul-
gariam that he was a ‘hack without the Sydney.’

XLIII. On a stingy host who invited guests and gave them
nothing to eat.
