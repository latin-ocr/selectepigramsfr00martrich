blanda, ⁴ seductive.’ Vayus either, ‘ Erec, unconfined,
licentious.’ So Cic. Or. xxm. 77, solutum quiddam sit ‘nec vayum
tamen ut inqredi libere non ut licenter videatur errare. So 11.
90. 1, Juventae vayae, i.e. licentious in style. Or ‘idle‚’ with-
out any aim or fixed occupation. So Stat. Sylv. IV. 6. 1, cum
patulis tererem vagus otia Septis.

9. tropa. So Schneidewin. Others read Popa or Rota.

If Tropa is right, and it seems most likely to be so, it is the
Greek adverb τρόπα. Tropa ludere is thus a special mode of
playing with the tali (the dice with four sides only marked,
the numbers two and five being omitted). It is described by
Julius Polluit, Book 1x.‚ as follows: 'H δὲ τρόποι καλουμένη
παιδιὰ ’γίγνεται μὲν ὡς τὸ πολὺ δι’ ἀστραγάλων (talis) οὕς ἀφιέντες
στοχάζονται βόθρου τινὸς εἰς ὑποδοχὴν τῆς τοιαύτης ῥιψέως ἐξε·
πίτηδες πεποιημένον.

nequiore is opposed to incertis, the meaning of which is
sufficiently well fixed by xrv. 16, Quae scit compositos manus im-
proba mittere ταῐοε, si per me (sc. Turriculam = fritillum) misit nil
nisi vota feret. Nequiore may imply cheating of some kind on
the part of the player‚ but it does not seem necessary to under-
stand by it anything more than is implied by compositos l.c.,
that is, the undue advantage given to superior knowledge and
skill as compared with the perfect equality secured by the use
of the box. Becker, Gallus Sc. x. Exc. 2, discusses the whole
subject. But in this passage he reads popa, and understands
nequiore to mean ‘loaded.’ ln that case a different meaning
must be assigned to incertis, for loaded dice would give the same
advantage to the player who used them, whether thrown from a
box or from the hand. If the reading tropa is adopted, the
nom. to ludit is of course December, and two distinct modes of
playing with dice are indicated. Popa is an easy reading. The
popae, priests’ assistants‚ were probably not the most respectable
members of society.

12. madidos. Cf. Horace, Odes 111. 21. 9, ‘ Non ille quan-
quam Socraticis madet sermonz‘busss though here probably there
is suggested also the idea of ebrios.

⁸13. ttenen as opposed to the robust grandeur of the great
epic poe .

mittere, a bold anachronism skilfully employed in order to
fiatter Silius.

XV. An answer to a man who, after a fruitless attempt to '

borrow money, which he never intended to repay, endeavoured
to borrow plate, which he meant to sell.
