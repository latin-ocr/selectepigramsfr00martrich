NOTES. IV. viii. l—x. 8. 257

vm. Addressed to Euphemus chief structor to Domitian,
asking him to present a copy of the fourth book to the
Emperor after, or at (see v. 7) dinner. Incidentally Martial
describes the routine of the Roman day.

1. salutantes. Of. 111. 36.

conterit. The salutatio was an irksome duty in itself, and
made more so by the obligation laid on the salutatores to ap-
pear in the cumbrous toya. 1. 108. 8.

2. tertia. Law and other business began at the close of
the second hour, and ended at the close of the seventh, with
an interval (sixth hour) for those who required the siesta.
Martial here gives the usual hours. It is quite plain from
passages in Martial himself, as well as in other authors, that
these hours were not universauy observed. Cf. 1. 108. 9; 111.

5. palaestris, including the bath. Of. 111. 20. 15. The
Thermae were sometimes called gymnasia.

6. frangere. Cf. 11. 59. 3.

7. decima. generally explained to mean that Euphemus is
asked to introduce the book to Domitian’s notice after the
cena, inter pocula. But it is a question whether he does not
mean that the ninth hour was the earliest dinner hour, and
that the court hour was the tenth. Domitian according to
Suetonius does not appear to have been given to wine drinking
after the cena, and ambrosias dapes seems to suggest the dinner
itself. All these words ambrosias, aetherio, ingenti, dcc„ are
chosen to gratify Domitian’s conceit of his divinity.

On the Roman horaz?9 of the time between sunrise and
sunset, see Becker's Gallus, Excursus v. sc. 11. The different
lengths of the hours in summer and winter may account per·
haps, partly, for the differences in the dinner and bath hours;
e.g. the ninth hour at Midsummer would begin at 2·31 P.M.,
mid-winter, at 1·29 PM. Pliny (Epist. 111. 1), speaking of his
friend Spurinna, says that his hour for the bath was the 9th
in winter and 8th in summer. The dinner-hour would vary
accordingly.

X. To Faustinus, with a copy of his book.
1. fronte. Cf. 1. 66. 10.

6. spongia. Pliny XXXI. § 131. Medici inscitia eas (spon-
μίας) ad duo nomina redeyere; Africanas quarum firmius sit
robur, Rhodiaca-sque ad fovendum molliores.

8. emendare, to correct faults, e and menda.
