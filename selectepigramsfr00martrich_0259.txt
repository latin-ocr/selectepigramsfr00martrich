NOTES. ΙΙ. lxxxvi. 6—xc. 1. 233

6. tam. So. ‘ as some would like to believe.'

7. quid, sl. ‘What if you should bid Ladas to pass along
the narrow surface of the spring-board?’

petauri. Juv. inv, 265, Mayor's note. It was a spring-
board or something equivalent‚ by means of which tumblers
performed their evolutione. The passage in Manilius ‘ corpora
quae valido saliunt eoecussa petauro,’ &a is very obscure, but
even there the meaning given above seems to suit better than
that of a suspended wheel. In Martial xx. 21 ‘quam rota
transmisso totiens intacta petauro’ it evidently means the man
who leaps from a springboard through a wheel; or was there a
word petamus :petauristarius ‚²

The meaning here is: would it not be absurd to set a
champion runner (Ladas was an Olympio vietor. His name
was used generally for a runner of remarkable swiftness. J uv.
1111. 97. Mart. X. 100. 5, where he compares a plagiary‚ who
mingled Martial's verses with his own, to a man with one leg
as swift as that of Ladas, but the other a wooden leg) to run
full speed along an acrobat's plank? It would be a difficult
thing to do no doubt, but a Ladas can do something better.
Why should he waste his special powers in doing what is
difficult perhaps, but degrading to him—what a man without
the runner’s physical excellence can learn to do by practice?

9. turpe. ‘Itis degrading to make to oneself hard non-
sense-tasum, and labour spent on fooleries is sheer stupidity.’

11. circuli& ‘ His precious orowds'y of admirers who
throng round him.

circulus. Contemptuous diminutive, instead of corona.

Palaemon. A poetaster and improvisatore, and the most
eonoeited of yrammaticir (Tutors). Suet. de illustr. Grammat.
23. He also aimed at unoommon metres. Scripsit variis nec
vulyaribus metris.

XC. To Quintilian, the famous professor of eloquenee (ΑΛ).
35—95) at Rome, like Martial, a native of Spain.

1. vagae moderator. ‘⁴ Though Q. shares to some extent
the faults and defeots of his time, he is still fully alive to them,

and attempts to correct them in his style by reverting to the
(simpler) manner of a better period.’' Teuffel ς 320.

vagae. Cf. ιν. 14. 7.
