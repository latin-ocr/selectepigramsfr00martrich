384 ΛΤΟΤΕΒ. Χ. xxxvii. 4—17.

4. callaicum, Cf. 1v. 39. 7, used here for ‘ Spanish.’

si quid is used as one word, an indefinite interrogative.
⁴ Is there anything ?’ Strictly speaking, it is elliptical, quid
mandas, si quid mandas? What are your orders, supposing

you have any ἲ
Martial enquires whether there is any commission he ean

execute for Maternus in Spain, apparently by way of tan-
talising him.
5. Laurentino. A district about 12 miles from Rome,
{3113} marshes about it, where apparently Maternus had a
ranas ducere does not necessarily mean that Maternus
fished for fmgs, but that they were what he was most likely to

catch. It weakens the satire to suppose a zeugma here for
ranas (audire) et aeos ducere.

6. aeos. Small worthless fish.

7, 8. The sense is, that the mullets of the Spanish sea
were so large that no one thought of keeping any that he
caught under 3 lb. weight (the average weight of mullet was
21b.)‚ but threw them back into the water.

saxa. The mullet, according to Pliny, 1x. ἓ 64, fed on
sea-weed amongst other things. This it would find most readily

among the rocks.

9. pelorida. A kind of muscle. Martia} opposes it to
the oyster, v1. 11. 5. The sense here is that in Italy oysters
are above an ordinary man’s means living in the country,
and he has to put up with inferior fish, whereas in Spain,
oysters as fine as (not envying) the Lucrine are so plentiful
that slaves eat them.

summa mensa. At your best dinners, lit. ‘ when your

table is at its highest or best.'
Some translate, ‘to finish your dinner with &c.‚’ but shell-

fish formed part of the yuszus.

10. quodque. Some shell-fish is meant, but it is im-
possible to say what. Cortex is used simply for ‘ coating‘ or
⁴ covering.’ Very possibly the common muscle is meant.

11. liventia. Cf. 1x. 23. 5.

13-17, Here you will hunt the useless fox, who will
maim your dogs. In Spain, I shall use my net, still wet from
being used in the sea, to catch the plentiful hares.

17. piscator, sc. tuus.
