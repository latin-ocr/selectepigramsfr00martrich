288 NOTES. V. xxxviii. 6-xlix, 10.

6. Castor was the eques, Pollux the boxer. Without his
brother Calliodorus was a full knight.

01⁸3.ss = esses.

7. “unus sitis is Martial’s way of saying that the two
brothers together only make up one eques. 1 suppose he must
mean that Calliodorus by his conduct says practitally unus
sedemus, which would be grammatically objectionable, a thing,
which, by the way, unus sumus or sitis is not.‘² Prof. Co·
nington‚ Journal of Ph-ilology, Vol. 11. Ρ. 111.

9. aut. ‘ or else.’

10. alternis. Castor, according to the legend, shared his
immortality with Pollux, each spending six months in Hades,
and six months on earth.

XLIX. On a man with bushy hair on either side of a
bald cr0wn‚ arranged probably in an elaborate manner, and,
according to Martial, presenting from behind the appearance
of three headS. The real point of attack is the man’s greed
at the distribution of refreshments in the theatre. Martial
attributes satirically his good fortune in securing three panaria
to his remarkable personal appearance.

1. sedentem, in the theatre or amphitheatre.
3. fefellit. ‘ Ι counted your bald pate wrong‚’ Paley.

8—10. It was not unusual at the shows for the emperors
to distribute refreshments to the spectatorS. This was done
in three ways: (1) tickets were given entitling the holder to
be served with provisions, comp. 1. 26. (2) eatables were
handed round in small baskets (panaria and sportellae). These
could apparently either be eaten on the spot or carried away.
(3) Huge dishes were carried round from which the spectators
helped themselves. Besides these refreshments‚ on great oc-
casions presents were distributed, either on the spot or by
ticket. Suet. Domit. c. 4, ‘Dedit iuter spectaculum vianet-is
{amissionum epulum. Septimontiali sacro primo die senatui
equitique panariis, plebi sportellis cum obsonio distributis,
initium vescendi primus fecit: dieque proximo omne 9enus
rerum missilia sparsit :’ and Nero c. XI. ‘Sparsa et populo
missilia omnium rerum per omues dies (of the ludi maximi):
singyula quotidie millia avium cujusque yeueris, multiplex penus,
tesserae frumentariae, vestis, aurum, arqentum, qemmae, mar-
qaritae, tabulae pictae, mancipia, jumenta, atque etiam man—
suetae ferae,· novissime naves, insulae, ayri! Most of these
must have been given by ticket (tesserae). Statius, Sylvae
