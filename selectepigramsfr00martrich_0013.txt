INTRODUO'A'ION. xi

It is impossible to say exaetly at what time 116
became possessed of this house. It is equally uncer-
tain when he became the owner of the Nomentanum to
which he refers so often, and which he abuses so freely.
But he probably had possessed the latter for some
time before he obtained the former. The Ν 011161116116
villa was according to his own account a miserable
place. The house let in the rain until one of his
friends tiled it for 11111133. The garden produced
nothing but some sour wine and some ‘leaden 6111116334.ι
It was so small that an ant could eat the produce of it
in one day3 there was not room for a cucumber to grow
straight in it, and a snake could not lie at full length
in it. A field-meuse made worse havoc in 113 1311611 1116
Calydonian boar in its own country, and a swallow used
up all the corn-crop 130 make its nest³⁵. The only use
of it to him was to enable him to get away from 1116
din of the city and from the persecutions of bores³⁶.
On the other hand 1116 anxious desire he displays on
his leaving Rome to have this villa kept in order ³⁷, is
scarcely in harmony with the description given above,
unless we suppose him to have possessed two villae,
which does not seem probable

Both in his new house, as well as in his garret
lodging‚ he lived a life of rathei monotonous routine,
v aried only by visits to his own vilia, and to his friends
at their various country and seaside 1·esidences³⁹. >On
one occasion we find him making a tour of some length
through the towns in the neighbourhood of the
Aemilian Road. At Rome the day was spent partly
in persor-ming the officium of a client to his patrons,
attending their morning levee‚ accompanying them
