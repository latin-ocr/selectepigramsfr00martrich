386 NOTES. X. xlviii. 2-9,

2. pilata. This line is in all probability corrupt. Fried-
lauder, comparing nv. 163. 1, ‘Redde picam sonat aes ther-
marum? suggests for the first half of the line, ‘ Atque pilam
reddit.’ But he suggests nothing for the second half. E.
Wagner has suggested ‘jam aere jubente (or sonante) cohors.'
to which F. objects that the elision though not without pa-
rallel (xn. 68. 3, Νοη sum eqo causidicus) is objectionable‚ but
more particularly that cohors could not be used unqualified for
a company of ball-players. Heinsius emended the line thus ε
‘Et pila jam, tereti jam subit aere (or orbe) trochus‚’ but the
sense of subit in his emendation is not clear.

3. temperat, opposed to nimio and immodico. The eighth
hour was as a rule the hour when bathing began in the public
baths, and was the hour fixed by law by Hadrian for the baths
to open. At this time they appear to have opened as early
as the sixth hour (perhaps an hour earlier, JuV. xr. 204).
In the generality of baths the heat appears to have been
gradually reduced from the sixth hour. Those persons there-
fore who required a higher temperature than the ordinary,
took their baths earlier.

The ‘ immoderate Nero ' here evidently means a temperature
such as that regularly maintained 'm the thermae Neronianae.
Of. 111. 25, of a frigid speaker, ‘si temperari balneum cupis
fervens, Faustina ....... Roya lavetur rhetorem Sabinaeum. Nero-
nianas hie refriyerat thermas! Both Martial and Statius are
loud in their praises of the elegance and comfort of these
thermae. They were situated in the Campus Martius, near
the Parthenon. They were afterwards restored by Alexander
Severus, and named after him Alexandrinae. Burn, p. 341.

Lupum. A friend of Martial‚ whom the latter advises to
make his son an auctioneer, or an architect‚ if he wishes
him to get on in the world, v, 56. To him is also addressed
x1. 18. But it is a question whether that epigram proves him
to have been the donor of the estate there mentioned. Brandt.
