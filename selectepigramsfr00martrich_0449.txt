dinner in the summer houses or on the lawn (v. 62). But that
a house—either villa or domus—must be meant here as well as
horti seems clear from V. 7, Atria lonya patent, which words
Mr Mayor omits in quoting this epigram.

1. daphnonas. x, 79. 5.

⁹ pityonas. Fine-groves, but a various reading is cypa-
ηεοε.

2. non mima, baths, far exceeding the wants of one man,
with an allusion to his inviting no guests.

3. porticus. 1. 12. 5.
4. onyx. Prob. in the batha VI. 42. 14.

5. hippodromon. A drive or racc-course, in which the
owner drove or rode. In the gestatio he was carried in lectica
or sella. See ΜΓ Mayor on JUV. 1. 0.

forcibly abducted‚ and had returned to him again. Rufus was
a poet, and an orator.

2. attonitis. Has very nearly the same signification as
moestis in Horace 11. i. 13. Expressing the state of mind and
appearance of men whose faculties are absorbed by sear and
anxiety. ‘Astonied’

vox, in apposition to Rufus

t5' narraris. Rufus tells the story of your abduction and
re urn.

fabula. Hor. Epod. x1. 8, Fabula quanta fui!

9. ridet, &a Another reading for audit is odit, which
does not give a good sense. Heinsius proposed as emendations
laudat or -aco plaudit...amori. The simplest emendation
would be to transpose the two verbs. audit et...ridet would be
quite simple and intelligible; but it is not au unlikely that
