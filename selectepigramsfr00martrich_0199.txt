had a lake formed in the Campus Martius for the purpose,
ec. 46. Suet. Jul. c. 39. This lake was subsequently (B.c. 43)
filled up on sanitary grounds. Augustus formed another lake
for the same purpose, on the other side of the Tiber, on which
he exhibited a magnificent sea-sight, representing the battle of
Salamis, Β.ο. 2. ovid, Art. Am. 1. 1723 Tac. Ann. x11. 56.
These lakes were also called Naumachiae. The next great
exhibition of the kind recorded, is that of Claudius on the lake
Fucinus, repeated afterwards with the addition of a land-battle
on bridges. See xxvur. Introduction. Nero (Dio ease. 61.
c. 20) and Titus (Suet. Tib. c, 7) both made use of Augustus's
naumachia for similar entertainments, but Domitian constructed
another lake near the Tiber on a very large scale. Suet. Dom.
o. 4, ‘Edidit navales pugnas paene justarum classium effosso et
circumstructo juncta Tiberim lacu.' Nero was the first ap-
parently who utilised an amphitheatre for the same purpose.
And the Flavian amphitheatre was put to the same purpose by
both Titus (Dio Cass. 66. c. 25) and Domitian (Suet. Domit.
c. 4); one of these last named exhibitions is probably meant
here. The crews in these sea-fights, which were real not sham
fights, were probably slaves, Tac. Ann. vn. 56.

Martial supposes some foreigner to see the amphitheatre
for the first time on the occasion of a naumachia, and warns
him against what would be a natural mistake to make.

1. longis=lon9inquis, a late use of the word.

2. cui. lit. ‘To whom the light granted to you now (ista)
has been the first light of the sacred show.’ The idea of prima
lux is that of ‘dawning, appearing for the first time ;' ‘on
whose eyes the vision of the sacred show has dawned for the
first time now3' that is, in prose, ‘ you who are seeing an exhibi-
tion in the amphitheatre for the first time now on the oc-
casion of the naumachia : ’ M unus, generally used of gladiatorial
exhibitionS, is here apparently used of any exhibition; unless it
means ‘the B00n‚’ that is the amphitheatre itself, bestowed on
the people by the Flavii.

sacri. Either as given by a divine emperor, or because the
amphitheatre was dedicated to more than one god—Diana,
Pluto, and possibly Neptune. Lipsius, de Amphith. c. 4.

3. ne te &a ‘That you may not be deceived ac„ (Ι tell
you) it was land here just nOW.’ cf. 1. 70. 13.

navalis Enyo-:navale proelium. Enyo was sister of Ares.
