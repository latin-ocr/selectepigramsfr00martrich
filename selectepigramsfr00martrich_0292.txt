4. Phidiaci. The famous sculptor and friend of Pericles.
He was the first great master of the art called in Greek τορευ-
τική in ‘Latin caelatura, the art of working in reh'ef in metals.
This was necessary to him in the execution of his great works,
such as e. g. his Chryselephantine statues. The vasa ascribed
to him, as well as to the other amisis, were probably studies by
which they practised ease and finish in minute details. Cf. 111.

toreuma. Toreumata or vasa caelata included all metal
vessels in raised or relies work. These were either (1) pro-
duced all in one piece, in which case they were either (a)
moulded solid, the inside surface being smooth, or (b) punched
out from the inside; or (2) produced in two pieceS‚ the raised
work being formed separately and fastened on to the body of
the vessel by means of lead or 'rivets In this case the raised
work would be either moulded (emblemata) in thin plates, or
hammered out (crustae). In all cases the work would be
finished with the graver (caelum, τορεύς). Marquardt‚ v. ii. 274.

5. Mentoreos. The most celebrated of the Greek caelatores
to which branch he confined himself. His larger works perished,
