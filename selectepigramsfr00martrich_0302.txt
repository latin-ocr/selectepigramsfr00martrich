LXXXVI. If only his book can win the approval of the
great critic Apollinaris, it will be safe. Apollinaris, the pos-
sessor, apparently, of a villa at Formiae (x. 30), was a friend of
Martial and a favourable critic of his poetry (vn. 25. 89). Martial
apparently valued his good opinion, and on one occasion thinks
it necessary to apologise to him·for the grossness of some of
his epigrams. It is possible that he was the Domitius Apol-

11. inversa. ‘ O little book only fit to be used on the clear side
of you by schoolboys' labouring pens‚' lit. ‘only fit to be ploughed
