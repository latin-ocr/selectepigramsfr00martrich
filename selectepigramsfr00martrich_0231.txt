ηαπσὶριιοᾳᾶιε utuntur! Cicero however always wrote it as a
Gree wor .

CXVI. Anepitaph on Antulla, daughter of Faenius From
Ep. 114, we learn that the ground in which Antulla was buried
adjoined the property of Faustinus. This however does not
fix the locality with certainty, because Faustinus had villas
both at Baiae and in the Tiburtine territory. Faustinus was a
rich man and a poet, to whom Martia] addresses many epigrama
The third book appears to have been dedicated to him, 111. 2,
and a complimentary copy of Book IV. was sent to him as soon
as it was published 1v. 10.

1. sacravit. The monument would probably have stated

upon it the amount of ground consecrated to the dead. cf.
Hor. Sat. 1. viii. 12.

5. aliquis. The use of the more definite aliquis instead of

lquid may indicate that Faustinus wished to purchase this
an .

6. serviet is apparently used in quite a general sense.
This land will be devoted to its owners, the dead, that is,
buried in it will have perpetual dominium of it. It cannot pass
into other hands. Land so consecrated was considered to be
not available for any other purpose, and on the monument
would be inscribed H. M. H. N. S„ i.e. Hoc monumentum
haeredem non sequitur. The ground was considered the absolute
possession of the dead. It could not pass to an heir, and so it
could not be sold. It was, so to speak, considered dead itself.

CXVII. An answer to a man who was perpetually trying to
borrow Martial’s book of Epigrams to read. The poet refers
him to his publisher.

6. Pirum. ‘The pear tree’ was a locality in the 7th
region. Compare the ‘ Pomegranate’ in the 6th, in the neigh-
bourhood of which Domitian was born. Burn, R. and O. p.
249. Probably the locality was so named from some celebrated
pear tree which had stood there before it was covered with
buildings.

7. et scalis. Cf. 1. 108. 3. ·

sed altis, Cf. 1. 43. 9.

8. Arg-netum. Cf. 1. 2. 8. Martial splits the word in two

in accordance with the old derivation of the name. Verg.
Aen. vm. 345.
