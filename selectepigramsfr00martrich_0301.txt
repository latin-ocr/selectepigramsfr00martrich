NOTES. IV. lxiv, 30—lxxv. 275

30. Molorchi. ‘Of Molorchus 'm the early days of his new
wealth‚' or ‘ so suddenly enriched.’ Lit. ‘but now made rich.'
Molorchus was the vine-dresser of Cleonae who entertained
Hercules before his encounter with the Nemean lion, and was
rewarded by a grant of the land in the neighbourhood of Nemea.
There is no need to understand an allusion to a chapel in honour
of M. built by Domitian, near his temple, to Herculea on the
Latin way, if it ever was built.

31. parva, i.e. ‘You who are never satisfied with the size
of any estate.’

32. centeno ligone, i.e. with 100 slaves,

34. uni. ‘Give up Setia to one husbandman,' i. e. turn all
Setia into one estate. Setia (famous for its wine) was on a hill
overlooking the Pontine MarsheS. xm. 112, Pendula Pomptinos
quae spectat Setia campos.

LXXHI. In praise of Vestinus, very likely the Vestinus
mentioned by Tacitus, Hist. Ν. 53, as ‘vir equestris ordinis
sed auctoritate famaque inter proceres‚’ to whom Vespasian
entrusted the care of restoring the capital.

1. gravis, ‘ sinking fast.’
3. sorores. Cf. IV. 54. 5.

5. Friedlander would place a comma only after mora„
and a full-stop after amicis. 1f this punctuation be adopted
vivat must certainly be read instead of vivit. The meaning as
it stands in the text is ⁴ Dead as he was to all selfish interests,
and only desiring life for the sake of his friends, the Fates were
inclined to grant his prayer.’

8. senem. When he had done this he thought he had
lived long enough.

LXXIV. On two stags who fought and killed one another,
in the arena. Cf. iv. 35. The recommendation to Caesar to
let loose the dogs upon the stags to save them from one another,
is like the paradoxical recommendation to the hare to fiy to
the lion’s mouth for refuge in case of danger, in 1. 6, Intro-
duction.

LXXV. Nigrina, happy in her own disposition, and in the
husband of her choica shared all her property with her hus-
band. Thus, by comparison with other Roman wives, she
proved herself a better wife than Evadne or Alcestis. They
proved their love to their husbands by sels-sacrificing death,
she by seli-sacrificing ffle.
