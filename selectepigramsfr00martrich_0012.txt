donor, or of some other rich friend ²⁴. It is unnecessary
to quote any more of these pleadings of poverty3 but
poverty is a relative term, and in spite of all that the
poet says, we cannot help thinking that many a
literary man nowadays would be quite content with
Martial's income. It is easy enough for us at the
present day to understand how the wealth of jockeys
and musical mechanics might gall Martial and make

that Martial was a poor man who contrived to get
through a good deal of money, and who mistook for
poverty, a capacity for spending more than he could get.

In his cenacula on the western slope of the
Quirinal he continued to live until he exchanged it for
a small house of his own in the same neighbourhood,
