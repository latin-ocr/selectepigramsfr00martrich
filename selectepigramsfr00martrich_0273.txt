NOTES. ΠΙ. 1. 3—lii. 247

L. On Ligurinas, to whom are addressed also Epig. 44 and
45 of this book, an uncompromis'mg poetaster, who invited
people to dinner in order to read his poems to an audienee.

3. soleas. The shoes were used for walking on the floor
of the house. They were carried to the house by the guest
himsself, or his slave, put on on entering the house, taken off
when guests lay down to dinner, and resumed when they rose
from table. Horace, Epist. 1. xiii. 15, ut cum pileolo soleas con-
viva tribulis (portat), and Sat. 11. viii. 77, soleas poscit, practi-
cally equivalent to ‘ rises from table.'

4. oxygarum. Another name for what is usually called
yar-am, a sort of caviare made from the juice of the scomber.
The lactucae and ¹aarum were both partsJ of the qustatio, or
gustus, or promulsis, the preliminary part of the Roman
dinner. xiii⁴ 14. ‘Glaudere quae coenas lactuca solebat avorum,
Dic mihi cur nostras inchoat illa dapesss’

5. fercula prima appears to mean the removes of the coena
proper, the substantial part of the dinner, as opposed to the
mensae secundae pastry, desert, &a Fercula, properly⁷ ⁴ trays:
were the courses brought in on dishes or waiters of various
patternS, and placed on the table, where they were carved by the
structor. Τ110 number varied at different times and in different
houses. Juvenal speaks of people dining by themselves off
seven courses, as a mark of the luxury of his times. Probably
from three to six was the usual number. Becker's Gallus,
Scene ix, , and Excursus.

7. broma. Schneidewin’s reading, instead of the old
librum. ‘A fifth dish of food for the mind.' So cibus is used
metaphorieally. Friedlander suggests, Promis.

8. putidus. ‘A boar is nauseous, served up so often as
that.' A man would get tired of boar (the favourite pisce de
resistance of the Romans) if it was served up in five courses,
one after another. Putidus is subjective.

9. scombris. 111. 2. 4.

LII. On a man who was suspected of setting fire to his
own house. He had bought it for 2ΟΟ,ΟΟΟ sesterces (ducenis
sestertiis is abl. of ducena sestertia), whereas the subscription
raised to indemnify him amounted to 1‚000,000. The epigram
is interesting in its allusion to the practice of raising subscrip-
tions among the wealthy friends of those who possessed such,
to repair such accidental losseS. Comp. J ων. 111. 212, et sqq.
