6. caelius. ‘In the time of the Empire‚ many palaces
of the richer classes stood upon the Caelian. Among these
we have distinct mention of the houses of Claudius Cen-
tumalus (which was visible from the Arx} of Mammurra, and
of Annius Verus (in which Marcus Aure ius was born). Tet-
ricus also, the unsuccessful rival of Aurelian, built a magnificent
residence on the Caelian.’......... ‘ The Caeliolus (Varro), called
by Cicero Gaelicolus, and by Martial Caelius minor, is sepa·
rated from the Caelius proper by a depression which corresponds
to the line of the via and piazza della Navz‘cezza.'......‘1t was
inside the Servian walls...and in later times it was united
with the Caelian district. These two facts seem to exclude
the supposition that the name belonged either to the length-
ened eastern arm which runs out to San Giovauui in Laterano,
or to the hill near the Porta Latina now called the Monte
d'0r0.’ Burn, pp. 224, 220, 214.
