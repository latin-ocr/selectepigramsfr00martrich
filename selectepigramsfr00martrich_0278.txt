of the Lucrine lake were supposed to be especially suitable
for this purpose, and to impart a peculiar flavour to the
oysters so imported‚ in addition to their hereditary flavour.
Pliny N. H. xxxn. ξ 61, ‘gaudent (ostrea) et pereyrinatione in
ignotas aquas. Sic Brund-asina in Averno compasta et suum
retinere sucum et a Lucrino adoptare creduntur! The oyster-
beds of the Lucrine lake were first developed by Sergius Orata.
The importation of oysters from a distance (e. g. Brundisium)
into the Lucrine was comparatively recent in Pliny’s time.

4. sugitur. ‘I cut my mouth in sucking a muscle out
ἓξ ἓξ shell‚’ the fish being carelessly opened, or not opened

5. boleti. The best kind of mushrooms, JuV. v. 147.
Though from Pliny's description we should rather infer that
&alifi->leti were mushrooms‚ and Funyi edible funguses ge-

suffles, ‘pig-funguses,’ the ancipites funyi of Juv. l. c.
Pliny, N. H. xxn. 96, tertium genus (fungorum) suilli venenis
accommodatissimi (Ρ more likely to poison people than not)

praesectum Neronis Vigilum et tribunos centurionesque. When
dried they were used medicinally for various purposes.

6. rhombo. The turbot. A favour-ite fish then as noxv.
The best came from Ravenna.

sparulo. A fish apparently like the turbot‚ but inferior;
possibly, the brill.

¹7. aureus. Gommonly explained of the colour of the
skin or flesh when the bird was very fat, but it seems far
more natural to understand it in its secondary sense of
‘matchiessss ‘first-rate,' perhaps with an indirect reference to

the eost of it.

immodicis=obesia Fat turtle--doves were counted a special
delieacy. xnl. 53, ‘ cum pinquis mihi turtur erit, lactuca valebis,
Et cochleas tibi habe. Perdere nolo famem‚’ i. e. he will not
partake of the qustus for sear of spoiling his appetite for the

turtur.

8. p1ca. A bird unfit for the table, and this, one that
had died in its cage.
