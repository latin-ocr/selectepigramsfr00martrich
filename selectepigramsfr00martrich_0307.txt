VIII. Phasis in the midst of loud rejoicing, that the
decree of Domitian had purged the knights' benches of unprivi-
ledged occupants‚ is removed by Latus, the custodian of the
seats in the theatre or amphitheatre. This epigram is gene-
rally explained to mean that Phasis, though he was grandly
pressed, was not possessed of the knights' fortune. But it seems
more likely, from the tone of the epigram, that Martial means,
that Phasis was a rich upstart, who was disqualified byhis
birth from sitting in the 14 rOWS‚ like Horace’s Menas (Epod.
4]‚ who was rich enough in all conscience, but yet having been
a slave sat Othone contempto, i.e. in defiance of the IaW.
Domitian's edict, like similar edicts of other emperors, very
soon probably became powerless‚ because he, like the other
emperors, violated it himself in favor of his own favorites ; but,
so far as it went, no doubt it purged the benches not only of
knights who had lost their fortunes‚ but of those whom no
amount of money could entitle to equestrian privileges on
account of their birth, 11. 293 on these qualifications see Fried-
lauder, 1. 268. V. 35 describes the ejection of a slave from
the knights’ benches who, while loudly asserting his right to be
there, was convicted by a key falling out of his pockets.
