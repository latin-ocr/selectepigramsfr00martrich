question.

The date of his death is quite uncertain, but we
should probably place it not long after the publication
of the twelfth book in A.D. 102.

Theolzaraccer by almost all his critics. He has also
⁰s Martia& suffered a good deal from his apologists.
It is impossible to discuss the subject 111 detail here,
but it is necessary to say that he is commonly 0011-
demned as an abandoned profligate on evidence which
would not be taken in any law court. There is no
evidence to show that he participated in the grosser
'vices of his time. There is considerable probability
that he did not. For had he done so, many of his
epigrams would have lost their point. There is no

gives no 1111115 of the kind, and Martial evidently and
beyond a doubt speaking of himself says ‘Lasciva est

was said above, it is obvious that we have no right
to apply to the poet himself all that he says in 1110
11181 person, when such application would be directly
315 variance with a statement made by himself about
himself, and in the face of the sentence just quoted,
the loose epigrams of Martial give us no more right to
accuse him of loose morals than the amatory effusions
of a married poet would justify us in accusing him of
infidelity to his wife.

What Marti-al really stands convicted of on his
own showing, 18 of laughing at that which ought to
have roused in him shame and indignation‚ and of
making literary capital out of other men's vices.
This from a Christian point of view is bad enough,
and the same fault in a society as nearly heathen as
