XCIV. This epigram is generally interpreted to mean that
Hippocrates sent Martial a present of mulsum, made with
Sardinian honey, asking for a present of mulsum, that is
properly made mulsum, in return. But judging from the name
Hippocrates, evidently a fictitious one, it seems more natural
to suppose that Martial is speaking of a doctor, who sent him
a draught, and asked him for 'mulsum in payment, a request
which Martial affects to treat with comic indignation. The

XCVHI. On a wine merchant, who in a wet, and also
very bad wine season, made large profits by selling watered
wine. “ Martial’s meaning seems to be that the rain has not
been altogether bad for the wine trade, as it has enabled the
vintners to adulterate their wine more freely. The joke is
not unlike one which is sometimes made in dry seasons
that you ean get no milk because the cows and the pumps are
