he gave a banquet in honor of Domitian’s Sarmatian victories
vm. 78. 33 that he was praetor and consul rx. 42. 6,
111. 3. 10; that he was in love with, and subsequently married
a lady (of the name of Violantilla) whom Statius calls Asteris
and Martial Ianthis, vn. 14 and 15, 50. 1, m. 3. 12, vr. 21. 13
Martial also alludes to a poem of SteUa's on the death osa favorite
pigeon belonging to his mistress, Ι. 7, vn. 14; and speaks of
Stella as facundus and disertus.

Flacco, a poet friend of Martial, described as living in
poverty, I. 76. 3, 43 ‘ Pierios differ camus citharamque sororum
Aes dabit ex istis nulla puella tibi' and possibly also addressed
vm. 56—not apparently Valerius Flaccus the author of the
Argonautica. For Martial though speaking of his friend as a
poet nowhere makes any allusion to the Argonautica which
was written as early as Vespasian's reign. Valerius Flaccus
died before ΑΛ). 90, and belonged apparently to Setia.

unicum, ‘peerless. '

Lucanum the author of the Pharsalia. Martial on several
occasions expresses great admiration for Lucan, cf. v11. 21, 22;

historian than a poet, He sayS‚ ΧΠ. 194 ; (entitled Lucanus)

‘Sunt quidam qui me dicant non esse poetam
Sed qui me vendit bibliopola putat)

Lucan was nephew of the elder Seneca, ci. IV. 402.
‘Senecae ter numeranda domus.'

8. facimda because of its producing the three men just
mentioned. cf. vn. 22. 4.
