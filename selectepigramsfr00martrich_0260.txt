imaginibus. Medallions of bronze and silver, which had by
this time superseded the old waxen masks of ancestors, who had

gone completely out of fashion, yet it would appear from δαν.
v111. 19 that those families which possessed such cerae still re·
tained them and were proud of them. The upstart families

privilege of the jus trium liberorum granted to Martial ap·
parently by Titus. 111. 95. 5, “Praemia laudato tribuit mihi

times to be conferred at the discretion of the emperors on

childless and even unmarried people, without any regard to its
original intention.

reques .”
