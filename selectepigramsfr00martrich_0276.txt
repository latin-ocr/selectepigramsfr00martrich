250 NOTES. III. lviii. 22-29,

plumage: so in 1. 92. 7, cerea lacerna is a lacerna shiny with
age and wear: and even cerea poma in x. 94, though it
may indicate the colom, indicates more particularly the gloss
on the ripe eating-apple, and is opposed to plumbea, ‘dull
and unjnviting.’

22. serenum ‘clem-‚³ so it is used of water, VI. 42. 19,
{hssssg‘gfam candida tam serena lucet, ut nullas ibi suspiceris

lactei, either ‘infant ’ γαλαθηνοὶ, or it expresses the colour
of the fiesh of young children. Cf. Horace Epod. 11. 65.

vernae, slave-children, cf. 111. 1. 6.

23. festos, bright and polished, fit for a holyday. In
country houses the old custom of keeping the lares in the
atrium round the hearth was adhered to, instead of removing
them into a Lararium‚ this atrium, where the focus and lares
were, being in a wealthy man’s villa, in fact, the common
kitchen which served as a servants' hall as well. The master’s

24. cop0, according to Becker's supposition (Gallus 353),
was the manager of a caupona, or wine-shop attached to the
villa, for the purpose of selling conveniently and profitably
the wine (esp. the poorer sort) made on the estate. Martial
says this copo in the country did not grow pale with confine-
ment to the taberna like a copo in town, but got healthy
exerc1se.

albo, by a sort of hypallage expresses the effect of the
otio, ‘the sedentary life,’ on the copo. Comp. Horace’s ‘Tarda
podagra.' For this sense of albus ⁶ pale‘ cf. vn1. 26. 2.

25. 1100 per-cut. A play on the proverbial expression, et
oleum et operam perdere. The ‘professional‘ of the Palaestra
does not in the country, as in a public palaestra in the town,
spend all his time in attendance on others, and so reap no
substantial benefit himself from all his training (oleum the
0111113 was an essential part of the training)‚ but turns it to
advantage in snaring‚ fishing‚ hunting, 610. Such a villa as
Faustinus’s would no doubt have a palaestra attached to it.

29. urbanos may mean the slaves of the city establish-
ment, or very possibly city-friends of the host.
