174 NOTES. SPEOT. XXIV. 5—XXVIII.

5. specta. ‘Look on while the waters weary the war-god,'
that is, as long as the sea-fight laste. Another reading is
spectes dum laxent cic, ‘wait till the waters relax their strife.’
Dio Cassius says of a naumachia exhibited by Nero in his
amphitheatre in the Campus Martius, that immediately after it
was over, the water was drained off and a fight of gladiators

exhibited on dry land. No doubt the same could be done in
the Coliseum.

XXVI. On a sort of tableaux-vivants in the water.

Friedlander understands it to mean that swimmers repre-
senting sea-gods, Nereids dcc. disported themselves with oars,
anchors dcc. round a ship, but the expressions used (esp. v. 4)
seem to imply that the swimmers represented the various
objects (σακε, anchors διο.) themselves.

This exhibition‚ as well as the representation of the story
of Hero and Leander (Spect. XXV„ Quod nocturna tibi, Leandre,
pepercerit unda, Desine mirari: Caesaris unda fuit, cf. xxv b.),

2. faciles, ‘yielding.'
pinxit, ‘made pictures on.’

oar, &c.', ‘we thought we saw them form an oar and a boat'.

5. sidus Laconum. Castor and Pollux. ‘In-atres Helenae
lucida sidera) Hor. Odes 1. iii. 2.

The illusion was so complete that the spectatore fanoied
they had seen a real ship sailing‚ and real stars shining.

8. ‘The goddess of the sea must have been the author oi
this new art, unless she learnt it from the Emperor.’

XXVIII. On some exhibitions in the water before (v. 7) a
naumachia. It has been supposed that these performances
took place on rafts or floating bridges: and this view is sup-
posed to be confirmed by the account in Tacitus of a similar
exhibition in the time of Claudius Ann. xn. 57, ‘quue
