380 NOTES. X. xxvi. 4—xxviii. 8.

4. Lagaei. Egyptian, from Lagus, father of Ptolemy I.

6. tura. Perfumes were thrown on the burning pyre by
friends. The so-called lachrymatories were used for this
purpose. Becker's Gallus, p. 517.

7. victurum, from vivo. For the sentiment compare Ep.
2 of this book, vv, 11, 12.

XXVIII. On the temple of Janus in the Forum Nervae,
1. 2. 8. It is uncertain whether this temple was built by
Domitian, who began that Forum, or Nerva, who completed
it. Statius, 1v. iii. 9, ‘sed qui limina bellicosa Jam‘ <Iustis
leyibus et foro coronat‚' though showing that Domitian began
this Forum is not conclusive as to who built the temple of
Janus QuadrifronS‚ because he may be referring to the old
temple of Janus. From this epigram appearing in the second
edition of the lOth book one would rather infer that Nerva
was the Caesar meant3 for Martial would hardly sing Do-
mitian's praises in A. 1). 98.

1. sator. As the god who influenced the beginning of
{vgegty-{tlssiuffighelpgder of the universe included. Compare ovid,

2. primum. Ovid, Fasti, 1. 171 sqq. Janus was invoked
first in all undertakings, and in all prayers his name was
mentioned first, even before that of Jupiter. The reason is
given, Ovid, 1. 0.

3. pervius. The old temple of Janus was in the shape
of a single arch, standing between the Forum Romanum and
Forum Julium, affording communication between the two.
Ovid, Fasti, 1. 258, where see Mr Paley's note. The traffic
between the two fora would of course be very great: hence
plurima Roma. Roma = Romani.

5. donis means probably only the ornamentation of the
ggw7temple. For the use of dona applied to buildings, cf. vm.

6. tot, διο. That is, Janus had now as many faces as
there were sora. ‘It is at once evident that this temple of
Janus Quadrifrons had reference to the fact that the forum
formed a passage (transitorium) in one direction between the
Forum Romanum and the Subura, and in the other between
the Forum Auffusti and the Forum Pacis (Vespasiani).’ Burn,
p. 137.

8. Tne sense is, preserve to us a lasting‚ and uninterrupted
peace.
