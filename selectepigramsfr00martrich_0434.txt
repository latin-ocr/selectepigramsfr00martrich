common to give slaves the names of legendary personages, e.g.
Narcissus, Lucifer 3 also the names of kings, e.g. Pharnaces,
Mithridates, dcc. Marquardt v. i. 21 n. 93. It is a kind of
irony that slaves have at all periods been exposed to ; compare

the names ordinarily given by Americans and West Indjan
planters to their slaves, Pompey, Cicero, &a

The wife of a slave called Aeolus would naturally be called
Aeolis. Their daughter equally would be called Canace, the

daughter of the legendary Aeolus, if it struck the fancy of the
master, and he were sufficiently literary to do so,

XCVIII. On the custom practised by some men in Rome,
especially the ardeliones and captatores, of kissing every one
they saluted. No one, Martial says, was safe. It was a merely
conventional kiss, indicating in fact an absence of friendship,
and therefore the only chance of escape was to make a friend
of any man whom it was peculiarly disagreeable to be
kissed by.

sion.’

quacunque=quavis‚ ‘in every direction.'

5. mentum. Martial alludes to the dreadful scourge known
as mentayra, a most objectionable skin disease, that attacked
the chin first, and then spread over the whole face, and even
to the chest and hands, It appeared in Italy first in the reign

of Tiberius. It attacked men of the upper classes only, and

was conveyed from one to other by this practice of kissing.
