Mr Munro’s note in Mr Mayor's edition. Parchment being
dearer than papyruS, and the book (or volume in our sense of
the word) which consisted only of one or more quaternions of
parchment, probably requiring more careful writing than the
papyrus roll, it is possible that this form of his epigrams may
have been dearer than the other, and this may be one reason
with Martial for recommending it: for it is impossible to
believe with some authorities, that the poet derived no profit
from the sale of his books.

7. secundum. A bookseller‚ apparently once slave to Lu-
censis. Who the latter was is unknown. Scriverius would read
Secundi and take Lucensis as nomen yentile. Martial apparently
had several booksellers (or publishers? probably in Rome the two
were synonymous) Q. Polius Valerianus, Atrectus, and Trypho.
Martial's epigrams were published at intervaIS‚ in books, which
perhaps accounts for his having so many publishers. Lessing
very ingeniously suggests that in the case of popular authors,
different publishers by mutual agreement published the same
book in different forms and sizes.
