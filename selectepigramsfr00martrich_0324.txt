11. Taygeti. A kind of green serpentine. There were two
varieties, Auyusteum and Tiberium, called after the emperors in

points of colour) atque non tralucidi.' The use of it increased
rapidly in Rome. Four small columns of it, placed in his
theatre by Balbus, were considered a wonder: whereas Pliny
and his contemporaries, “ampliores triyinta videmus in cerza-
