NOTES. II. i. 6—vi. 3. 209

6. nec tantum ‘ nor be bound to devote so much time to
my poor trifles‚’ i.e. as a longer book would require. ‘He

won't be all day copying my poor epigrams.’

8. usque malus ‘though you may be as bad as ever you
can bc,’ lit. ‘continuously or unceasingly bad,’ i.e. without
any exception to your badness‚ without any redeeming feature.
So Verg. Ecl. IX. 64, where Professor Conington takes'usque
with eamus, but the sense appears to be rather, ‘let us go on,
but sing all the while (usque) as we go,’ the parenthesis (minus
via laedit) seeming to show that usque belongs to Cantantes;
Martial v. 60. 1 ‘aliut-res licet usque nos et usque,’ i.e. with-
out ceasing‚‘ ever so.'

9. te. ‘A guest can read you after his glass of calda
has been mixed, and before it has had time to cooL'

The cyathus, not a drinking vessel‚ but 3 measure, bore the
same proportion to the sextarius that the uncia did to the as.
Consequently the divisions of the as, e. g. triens, quincunx, were
constantly used to express drinking goblets containing so
many cyathi 4, 5, or whatever the number might be, i. e. ᾗ,
Π of the sextarius. Martial mentions even deunces, that is
cups containing ffi- of a sextarius. Cf. vr. 78. 6 misceri sibi
protinus deunces sed crebros (and plenty of them). Quincunces
and trientes appear to have been the commonest sizes.

Calda, a mixture of wine with boiling water, was a very
favourite drink. See Becker's Gallus, p. 493. tepesco here is
to grow warm from having been boiling hot ; so practically ‘to
cooL’ Martial says that this book is so short that 3 111311
might read it through while his nequ-s was cooling. For this
sense of tepesco cf. Lucan IV. 234 “Paullatim cadit ira ferox

mentesque tepescunt.’'

11. “Dost think that thy size will secure thee (against
neglect) ⁸> Aias! alas! short as thou art (sic quoque) how many
wiu deem thee long?'‘

VI. To Severus, a critic, complaining that he had urged
the poet to publish, and would not read his poems when they
were published. For Severus cf. v. 80.

1. 1 nunc. Cf. de Spect. xxm. 6 ‘so much for your
urging me,’ dcc.

3. eschatocofflon. The last page—derived either from
κῶλον or κολλάω, the last member, or the last strip of papyrus

glued on. In either case the meaning is the same. This
book was evidently a papyrus roll. See 1. 3.
