any nominally Christian society could be, cost Swift
preferment. Like Swift, Martial allowed his genius
sometimes to turn mudlarker, and make dirt-pies for
his own and others' amusement. And for this he
deserves censure. But a man may claim, if he likes,
to be judged by the standard of his own time, and
indignation at vice for its own sake, or shame at a
neighbour's impurities, were not feelings that belonged
to Martial’s time. A great man would have scorned
to do much that Martial stooped to do, but his
stooping to it under the circumstances does not
convict him of the exceptional innate depravity of
which he is commonly accusedffl.

But there is another indictment against Martial⁷s
character, his fulsome fiattery of Domitian. Had
Martial refused to flatter the emperor and the
emperor's favourites and informers, he would have
shown himself a great and good man. Equally by
condescending to fiatter them, he does not show him-
self a very bad man. He only shows that he did not
rise above the average morality of his time. Prac-
tically everybody in Rome rendered homage to the
court, who had any homage to render worth the
court's acceptance. Publicly to refuse to do homage
was as exceptional as it was dangerous. And Martial
perhaps had more excuse for his flattery than some
others. In the first place, the patronage of the court
was a necessity of life to him. In the second place,
the circumstances of his life predisposed him to

48 It seems hardly necessary to point out that only a com-
paratively small proportion of Martial’s epigrams are indecent.
Prof. Teuffel, indeed, says, ξ 317. 5, that the subjects of them
are derived mostly from the obscene side of real life. But it is
difficult to understand what he means by such a statement.
Out of about 1200 epigrams contained in books 1—xn, more
than three-fourths are free from any indecency. If the thirteenth
{rand fourteenth books were included, the proportion would be

rger still.
