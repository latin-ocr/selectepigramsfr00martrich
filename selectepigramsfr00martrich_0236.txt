Vitelliani, sc. pugillares, were writing-tablets of the most
expensive kind—so called probably from the name of the first
maker. They were used especially for love-letters. mv. 8.

The tabulae ceratae or cerae, pieces of wood covered with
wax, and written on with the Stilus, were most commonly used
by the Romans for any kind of writing where great length was
not required, e.g. for accounts legal documents, letters, δια,
when several of these were J'oined together (by means of wire at
the back) they formed what were called codices, and according
as two or three or more were fastened together, they were
termed diptycha triptycha δια, or, by translation, triplices
duplices, &a When these were of small dimensions they were
known as pugillares. The material generally employed for
common writing purposes was deal wood, but sometimes,
especially in the case of puyillares, more expensive materials
were used—citron wood, ivory, and sometimes parchment.

of the book, as soon as it was published‚ hoping for an imme-
diate and flattering reply.
