saecula. The lapse of ages enhances their value. Martial,
as well as other poets, charged it against some of his con-
temporaries that they cared for no poet, until he had been
buried for years.

12. monimenta is used of any record in a wider sense than
our ordinary use of the word monument. Cf. ΧΠ. 96, where
it is used of a kind of cups named after Vatinius, the cobbler
of Beneventum. These cups had long spouts resembling in
the popular imagination the nose of the cobbler, ⁴ Vilia sutoris
calicem monimenta Vatini Accipe.' Cf. Juv. v. 46.

ΠΙ. On a scurrilous poet, who passed off his own epigrams
as Martial’s. In Epigram 5 of this book, he imprecates a
terrible penalty on the scurrilous poet, stolaeve purpuraeve
contemptor, one who regards not flowing robe or laticlave
(matron‚ or senator). ⁴ May he be sent to Coventry by the
very beggars, may he envy the dead when he sees them carried
to burial, may he dle with dogs prowling round him, and.
vultures hovering over him waiting for his camase, and after
death be subject to the worst tortures of Tartarus3 and, worst
torture of all, may he be compelled there to confess that he

wrote his own verses.’

sordidum dentem. Cf. v, 28. 7, ‘robiyimsis cuncta dentibus
rodit) Horace, Epod. VI. 15, ‘si quis atro dente me petiverit,‘
a discoloured tooth is used to express envy and malice. Sor-
didum here perhaps adds the idea of foul language.

2. circulati-1015, fem. of circulator. The latter meant any

strolling vagabond, cheap-jack, nostrum-senet, juggler, acrobat,
who lived on the populace. The language would be much

what we should term ‘ Billirnysyatess
3. sulphurato. Cf. 1. 41. 4.
4. vatiniorum. See last epigram, v. 12.
