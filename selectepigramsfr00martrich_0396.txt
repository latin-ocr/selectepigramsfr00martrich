XCIX. On the receipt of a letter from Marcus Antonius
Primus, the famous Flavian general. He was the first to
declare for Vespasian, and by his influence secured for him
the legions of Moesia, and Pannonia. He fought and won
the decisive battle of Bedriacum against. the Vitellians, took
Cremona, then advanced, and occupied Rome, which he practi-
cally ruled until the arrival of Mucianus. Owing to his
rapacity and over-bearing disposition, as well as to the jealousy
of Mucianus, Vespasian never treated him with confidence, and
at the close of the civil war he seems to have retired into
private. life. He was a native of Tolosa in Gaul, and in his
boyish days rejoiced in the playful soubriquet of Becco, the
cock’s beak, Suet. Vitell. c, 18. In x. 23 (published in A. D.
98) he is said to be 60 years of age. Both there, and in x 32
<an1inscription for a picture) he is extolled for his purity of
character, from which we conclude that Martial had substantial
reasons for wishing to make a friend of him.

4. quem genuit seems to be suggested by the lives of his
namesakes M. Antonius, the triumvir, and Antonius Satur-
ninus. Primus fought to win the peace which secured the
tranquillity of the Flavian reigns. Or is Martial here speaking
of a son of Primus born after the accession of Vespasian?
