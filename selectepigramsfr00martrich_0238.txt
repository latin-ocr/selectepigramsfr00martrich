212 NOTES. II. xiv. 3-8.

3. Europen. Cf. 1. 108. 3. It was decorated with a fresco
of Europa and the bull.

In the portico or on the campus outside Selius finds a
rich friend Paulinus running, and angles for an invitation by

praising his matchless speed.

5. Septa. The Septa Julia. The voting place of the
Comitia Centuriam. It was a large marble enclosure sur-
rounded with a magnificent portico, begun by Julius Caesar and
finished B.c. 27 by Agrippa. In Martial's time it was a common
resort of slave vendors and loungers and dealers in fancy goods,
1x. 59, x, 80. It stood in the Campus Martius, near to the
Thermae Agrippae and the Vina Publica. On the discovery of
the exact site, see Burn, R. and G. 323—5. It was largely
added to by Hadrian.

6. The most natural interpretation of this line is that the
portico round the septa was adorned with fresooes representing,
among other subjectS, the Argonautic expedition. But as the
fresco of the Argonauts in the Posidonium or Porticus Neptuni
was so celebrated, the commentators all determine that that
portico must be alluded to here. If that be so, then petuntur
must signify simply the direction taken by Selius from the
porticus Europae. It is impossible to believe that Martial
meant to pass him from the Septa to the Posidonium between
petuntur and si quid. We must then assume that, proceeding
from the porticus Europae towards the Septa, he would pass the
Posidonium. As it seems difficult to say with certainty any-
thing more about these two buildings than that they were
somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Septa, it is impossible
to say whether this rendering is possible or not. The porticus
Europae, however, stood probably in the Via Lata region, to
the ΝΕ. of both the Posidonium and the Septa. Burn‚ R. and
C. 331. The first explanation seems far the most natural.

7. Memphitica templa. The temples of Isis and Serapis,
W. of the Septa, in the Campus Martius. The worship of Isis
after struggling for existence in Rome since the time of Sulla,
appears to have been established and recognised under the
Flavii. It was especially, apparently, encouraged by Domitian,
who restored the temples here mentioned after the disastrous
fire in A.D. 80, which injured more or less so many of the
buildings on the Campus Martius. Merivale‚ cc. 60, 62.

8. cathedris. The Cathedra was specially used by women,
and the worship of Isis was almost confined to women, those of
the most doubtful reputation being the most devout worship-
