232 NOTES. ΙΙ. lxxxvi. 2—4.

2. 1100. ‘And Ι (10 not read backwards a Sotadic ob-
scenity.’ That is, I do not write (or recite) lines which read
backwards would make Sotadics.

sotaden=0armen Sotadium. Ginaedum grammatically in
apposition to Sotaden is practically an adjective. Cf. 1. 3. 3.

Κίναιδοι was the technical name for the kind of poenis of
which Sotades was the chief exponent, and which, after his
time, were known as ᾅσματα Σωτάδεια. They were obscene
pieces, travesties (cf. the titles of some: Ἄδωνις, Ἀμάζων, εἰς
Ἃιδου κατάβασις) and lampoons. Sotades was a Cretan, of the
Alexandrian School of Greek poets of the 3rd Century 13.c.
He ventured to attack Ptolemy Philadelphus in an indecent
lampoon, and, after a vain attempt to escape, was enclosed in a
lead case, and drowned in the sea. Athen x1v.‚ p. 620, f. He
wrote in the metre known as Ionicum α majore given
above.

3. nusquam. ‘That nowhere the dear darling Greek echo
sounds in resrain.’

78 Graecula, contemptuous‚ as Graeculus esuriens, Juv. 111.

The allusion here is to the versus echoici or serpentini, ele-
giac couplets in which the first words of the hexameter recur
as the last half of the pentameter. Pentadius in Meyer's Antho-
logia No. 242, ‘Cui pater amnis erat fontes puer ille colebat,
Laudabatque undas, cui pater amnis erat‚’ &Q

4. mihi, 810. ‘And I have no Attis elegantly declaiming in
smooth and nerveless galliambics.'

dssctgt. Simple frequentative of dico ‘repeats ’ cf. tractat.
11. 7 . .

mlh-i. Ethical dative.

The allusion is apparently to the poem of Catullus, but it
is difficult to see why Martial introduces it here. The metre is
a simple and easy mette. It was so called from being used by
the priests of Cybele (hence Martial’s mollem), and scanned as
an Iambic rhythm. It is really a sort of trochaic verse, con-
sisting of a trochaic dipodia, preceded and followed by a paeon
tertius, and finished by a paeon quartus or a cretio.
