9. locariorum. Either poorer men, paid by the richer, to
secure and reserve for them them the best scats, or more pro·
bably, speculator-S who exhibited gladiatorial combam, to which
the public were admitted by payment‚ such as Atilius men-
tioned by Tacitus, Arm. IV. 62. If Hermes could be advertised
to appear, the charge could be so much higher.

ludim-um, women connected with the school, perhaps in-
cluding those ladies of the higher classes who studied gladia-
tory, such as Maevia, Juv. 1. 23. Certainly, as Friedlander

were not confined to women of their own class.'

understands V. 13 to be a description of Hermes as an anda-

mets covering the eyes), and explains lanyuida to mean ῑαη-
quidam caliginem inducente. The velites were gladiators accou-

lauder, 11. 520.

15. ter unus. ‘Three men 'm one3’ denoting general ex-
eeuenee‚ but with a special reference to his accomplishments,
mentioned in W, 11-13, The allusion to Hermes Trismegis-
tus, which all the commentators see, appears very far-fetched
and out of place.
