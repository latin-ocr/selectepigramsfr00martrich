NOTES. XII. i. 411

17. in pusillo loco, δια, a great many for a small place3
one or two malignant critics in Bilbilis would be as annoying
as a much larger number in Rome.

18. ne mireris. Not, ‘ do not wonder,’ but ⁸ γοα need not
wonder,’ after hearing what 1 have told γοα; lit. ‘(I have
told you all this) that you may not, &cl

21. cui non refero. ‘And Ι am not paying my debt ot
gratitude to you by merely performing what is within my
power ’; cf. Valerius Max. 1v. 8, ‘proni studii certius est indicium
supra vires niti quam viribus ex facili uti.- alter enim quod
potest, praestat ; alter etiam plus quam potest) Probably the
expression was proverbial.

22. imperavi. ‘I have imposed on myseli as a task what
Ι used to indulge in as a pleasure.'

24. adventoria. ‘Their proper welcome.’ coena adventoria,
or more usually adventicia, was a banquet given to friends or
relations coming from a distance, and was more elaborate
than an ordinary one, δεῖπνον ὑποδεκτικόν. Suet. Vitellius,
o. 13, ‘Famosissima super ceteras fuit coena ei data adventicia

a fratre! Martia] here uses it metaphorically of an aesthetic
feast. Cf. 111. 50. 7.

25. quae tantum, dcc. ‘ Which are only sase with γοα.’

26. excutere. To scrutinise‚ criticise, lit. to turn inside
out3 so to search a person. Cic. pro Ros, Am. ‘non excutio
te εἰ quid forte ferri habuisti’ (where it is used hali litera-Hy,
half metaphorically); Quint. 1. 4, ‘nec poetas Zeqisse satis est .-
excutiendum omne scriptorum genus! Comp. 1. 3. 8.

27. nitore seposito. ⁶ With unclouded eyes? lit. ‘ all that
can dazzle the eyes being removed) Comp. Horace, Sat. 11. ii.
5, ‘ cum stupet insanis acies fulyoribuS.’ Priscus is to allow no
consideratione of friendship or the like to interfere with his
judgment. Friedlander, Recensio locorum ἀφ, says, ‘ desideratur
favore, vel amore, vel tale quid) But nitore seems to give an
intelligible sense. Nidore is another reading. If this be right,
the idea would be much the same as that expressed by Horace
in impransi, l. c. v. 7.

28. non Hispaniensem, &a Not stom Spain, but Spanish,
i.e. ‘not the work of a Roman writer in the provinces, but of a
provincial)

Hispaniensis is ‘ living in Spaim’ as opp. to Hispanus, ‘a
native of Spain.’

L The 12th book was written in the winter, ΧΠ. 62.
