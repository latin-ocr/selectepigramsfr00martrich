Bellonae. There was an old Italian goddess of‘the name.
But the Bellona of later times was a foreign goddess, intro-
duced in the time of the Mithridatio wars from Comana in
Cappadocia, and worshipped with a 0th not unlike that of the
goddess Cybele. She was served by m‘ld ecstatio priests,
Ὲαηαείσί, Bellonarii, who carried the goddess through the city
in prooessi0n‚ clad in blaok robes, and in her temple eut them-

15—17. A man who can reckon up all the interruptions to
sleep at Rome, could tell the number of the hands that are
raised to olash vessels and instruments of brass when an
eclipse is seen.

The custom alluded to is that of mising adin with cymbals,
or brazen vessels of all sorts when an eclipse of the moon
took place. The belief on which this custom was founded was
that an eclipse was caused by magieians, who had power by
means of ineantations to pull the moon out of the heaven.
They raised this noise, therefore, to prevent the moon hearing
the incantations, and so to counteraot the evil power.

. The moon was supposed to be brought down by the ma-
gicians in order to impart certain magio properties to the herbs
they used. Gomp. Verg. Eel. vm. 69. Pliny, N. H. 2 g 54,
