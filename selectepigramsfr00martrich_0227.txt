LXXXV. Marius being in difficulties, ami wishing to sell
some property, but at the same time extremely anxious to be
thought perfectly solvent, instructed his auctioneer to give out
that his reason for parting with the property is simply its
unhealthiness. The auctioneer tells his lie so well that every
one believes him, and Marius is ‘hoist with his own petard,’
no one will bid for the property.

1. excultos..suburban.i...pu.lchra all intended to indicate
a kind of property that a man would not part with if he could

help it.
4. immo, ‘on the contrary, he is much more in a position

8. noxius. Ironical.

LXXXVIII. Epitaph on a young slave of Martial buried
somewhere on the Labican Road. The via Labicana began, as
did also the via Praenestina and the via Valeria or Tiburtina,
from the Esquiline gate. It ran past the Labicmm (La Colon-
na fifteen miles from Rome), and leavmg this on its right
proceeded to Ad Pictas where it joined the Latin Road, see
Burn. R. and C. pp. 381—437. Schneidewin in both editions
adopts the spelling Lavicana which appears to have the best
MSS. authority in its favour. Perhaps the quantity may have
had something to do with Martial's choice of this form. The
a of Labicum is usually short, Virg. Aen. vn. 796 picti scuta

2. levi suggests the common sepulchral form S. T. T. L.
sit tibi terra levis.

3. nutantia„ unsteady—top-heavy—implying much the
same as ruztura.

4. ruitura, cf. JuV. x, 146 Quandoquidem data sunt ipsis
quoque fata sepulcris.
5, 6. Some commentators understand by buxos and prata

wreaths of box-leaves and meadow flowers, others, trees planted
and turi, the latter seems most in accordance with v. 8.

XCIII. Epitaph on two first Centurions who were friends
in life and not separated in death: whether they had died in
Italy or in the provinces, whether they had served in two
legions quartered together or on detached duty, it is impossible
