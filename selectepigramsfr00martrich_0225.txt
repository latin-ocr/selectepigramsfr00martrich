NOTES. I. lxx. 9—lxxvi. 5. 199

9. Lyaei. A temple of Bacchus on the Palatine the
exact site of which is not known.

10. cybeles &c. There appears to be no certain informa-
tion as to what is here meant ; probably a Fresco in the temple
of Bacchus is meant3 another reading is leolus ‘the dome.'
If this be the right reading, the temple of Cybele on the
Palatine is probably meant 3 Burn, p. 159.

11. protinus, Immediately after you have passed the
temple of Bacchus, Proculus's house faces you on your left.

Fronte agrees with laeva a natural way of expressing that the
house fronted a man on his left.

13. nec. ‘And that you may sear no exclusiveness at
that door or pride in that house (Ι tell you) &cst ne prohibitive
in Latin follows the same rule as μή prohibitive in Greek. Ne
fac or ne feceris ‘Do not do 3’ ‘ne facias ‘that you may not do,’
a construction often used to denote the purpose intended in
making the statement which follows it. Cf. Horace Odes iv.
ix. 1 et sqq. Epist. 1. xii. 25.

17. quia. ‘Because‚ however those verses read, they are
such as a morning caller could not write: ' either Martial means
that a man who spent his time in salutationes could not write
poems, or more likely, that a hanger on of great men could not
express himself as freely as Martia] did.

LXXVI. To Flaccus on the unprofitable nature of the
Poet’s art. On this Flaccus, see 1. 61. 4.

1. pretium non vile. ‘No small reward of my labours:
said perhaps with an anticipation of what follows. His friend-
ship with Flaccus, the result of partnership in poetry, was
some compensation for his otherwise unprofitable labours.

2. Antenorei laris, i.e. Patavium. Antenor was the
mythical founder of the place, Virg. Aen. 1. 247.

4. existis. Sc. sororibus.

5. Minervae. From a comparison of this passage with
x. 19. 14, Totos dat tetricae dies Minervae Dum centum studet
auribus Minervae it would seem that Minerva besides being
the goddess of intelligence and practical sagacity was in some
special way connected with the legal profession at Rome.
She is here contrasted with Apollo the god of unremunerative

poetry.
