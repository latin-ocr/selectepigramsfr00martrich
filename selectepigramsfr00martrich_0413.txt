NOTES. X. xlviii. 10—20. 387

10. herba. eruca.

11. lacertos. A cheap sea-fish‚ eaten with eggs chopped
small, and rue (ratatis), which were placed either round or
upon it. Coupled with the cybium (xr. 27), salted slices of
fish (111. 2. 4), also a cheap dish. Comp. JuV. xrv. 131,
Becker's Gallus, p. 459.

12. madidum, served with muria, 1v. 88. 5. Compare
the description in Becker’s Gallus, p. 114.

sumen. 11. 37. 2.
13. gustus. 111. 50. 4.

cenula, in the restricted sense of cena=fercula‚ the
second or substantia] part of the dinner‚ between the gustus,
and the mensae secundae (sweets). The diminutive is ex-
plained by una mensa, the latter being used in the sense of ‘ a
course, ' ferculum. So coena is used, 11. 31. 5.

15. structoris. The slave whose duty it was to arrange
the dinner, and also to act as a scis sor, or emptor. Comp.
δαν. v. 120, sqq.

ofellae. Meat- balls; pork or bees (the tenderest part),
cut, or rolled in a hall, and dressed, or stuffed‚ with various
con’diments. They might be made very simply, as here, andm.
48. 17, subitae ofellae, or very elaborately. Apicius gives a
receipt for one ln‘nd which required two or three days to
prepare, v11. 265. The word 18 apparently not a diminutive,
but connected with a Sanscrit root pal=Greek πελ, 01· φελ,
Germ. bol, meaning ‘round.' The word offa (from which
was derived a dim. offula) seems to have been a mutilated
fomn of this word.

16. fabr-om, sc. cibus.
prototomi, sc. coliculi. Cf. x1v. 101.
rudes. Fresh, young, tender.

19. Nomentana. Possibly from the poet’s own farm,
but 11· it was like the rest of the produce of that estate, his
guests were much to be pitied.

20. Frontino. Consul for the second time, B.c. 97. This
epigram therefore belongs to the second edition only. This
man was inspector of aqueducts under Nerva, and author
of ‘ an account of the Aqueducts 01 Rome‚‘ as well as a military
treatise, Strateyemata.

prima. Friedlander‚ 111. 338, approves of the emendation
of Heinsius, trima, but there is more humour in prima.
