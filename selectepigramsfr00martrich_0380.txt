354 NOTES. IX. iii. 12—xiii. 7.

12. flavia templa. Cf. v111. 80. 7. The plural perhaps
refers to the temple of Vespasian, built by Domitian, as well as
the templum Flaviae yemis. See Burn, p. 120.

Latio polo. By ‘the Latin sky,’ Martial means the Romans
who had been deified, and who were enriched by the erection of
the Flavian temple. Compare Epigram 34 of this book; Jupiter
seeing the Flavian temple of the Augustan sky (the same sense
as the ‘ Latin sky’ here), laughingly contrasted it with the
sepulchre in Gnossus erected to commemorate his death, which
never took place (Idaei mendacia busti), and said, ‘cernite quam
plus sit Caesaris esse patrem! Cf. Cic. de N.D., ⁴ Tertius (Iupiter)
est em Idaeis Diyitis (al. Dactylis) cui inferias afferunt? Statius,
sylvae IV. iii. 19, speaks of Flavium Coelum, in connexion with
the Flavian temple.

13. sustineas. With this absolute use of this verb (=rem
sustinere) compare Cic. Ep. ad. Div. ΧΠ. 6, Brutus enim Mu-
tinae via· Jam sustinebat. For the sense of sustinere, cf. Livy,
v. 45, compressi a Caedicio rem in noctem sustinere.

The Augustus addressed is, of course, Domitian.

xm. One of three epigrams on the name of Earinus, a
favorite slave of Domitian. In Ep. xr„ Martial regrets that
the same license is not allowed to Latin poets as to Greek, who
could write Ἄρες, or Ἄρες, ἐαρινὸς, or εἰαρινός, as they pleased.

2. ver. Cf. 11. 46. 2.

3. Acidalia. vr. 13. 5. η

5. Erythraeis lapillis. Cf. vm. 45. 2, 26. 5.
6. Heliadum. Cf. 1v. 59. 1. ι

pollice trita. Made fragrant by rubbing. The name is
worthy to be inscribed in letters formed of pearls‚ or carved 'm
fragrant amber.

7. pinna scribente, ‘with lettered ssight) Palamedes was
said to have added the letter Δ or Τ (it is uncertain which) to
the alphabet‚ from observing the fiight of these birds, Hence
Martial calls them Palamedis aves, xm. 75, ‘Grues’ Turbabit
versus nec litera tota volabit Unam perdideris si Palamedis
avem.

Epigrams 17 and 18 of this book celebrate the dedication by
this same young gentleman of his mirror, ‘his beauty’s adviser’
(consilium formae), and his hair, in the temple of Aesculapius
(addressed as Latonae venerande nepos) at Pergamus, from
which place probably Earinus himself came.
