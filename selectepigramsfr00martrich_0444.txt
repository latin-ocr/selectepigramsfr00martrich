418 NOTES. XII. xxix. 1—12.

1. mapparum. ‘ Table napkins.’ From 11115 epigram, as
well as from 11. 37, vn. 20, and 1v. 46. 17, it is plain that the
guests brought their own napkins‚ though it is quite possible
that the host provided napkins as well. In fact, vv, 21 and
>22 of this epigram seem to imply that he did so. The napkins
brought by the guests were very likely for the purpose of
taking home apophoreta. Marquardt, v. i. 322. Mappa is
also used for a handkerchief‚ apparently in v. 7.

2. Massa. Prob. Baebius Massa is meant, Tac. Agric.
c. 45, a favourite mountebank of Nero's, accused and con-

3. sinistram. “ The Latin thief's...sinisterity of hand
became proverbial. Not only does Ovid (Met. xm. 111) speak
of notaeque ad furta sinistrae.....‚Not only does Catullus ex-
claim (xn.) Marrucine Asini, manu sinistra non belle uteris in
joco acque vino .· tollis lintea neqleffentioram, but the same poet
apostrophises the two thieving umbrae of Piso as Porci et
Socration, duae sinistrae (the two left hands), Pisonis (xnvu. 1).
So one detects in Martial x11. 29, 3-4, what at first sight
might be unobsewed, the seizure (teneas) of the lest hand
of the intending napkin-stealer, and the simply watchiny the
ri9ht, the less suspected hand.’ Shilleto in Journal of Phi·
lology, vn. 155.

5. cervinus. It was a common superstition that stags
by their breath drew snakes out of their holes. Lucret. VI.
765, ‘Naribus alipedes ut cervi saepe putantur ducere dc late-
bris serpentia saecla ferarum)

6. Iris. The rainbow was supposed to draw up the water
into the clouds, Ovid, Met. 1. 271, ‘concipit Iris aquas alz‘·
meumque nubibus affert.

casuras, ‘ To fall again.

9, 10. The signal for starting the raees in the circus was
given by the president by dropping a napkin from the balcony
over the carceres where he sat. See Guhl and Koner, fig.
499,dwhere a president is represented holding a napkin in his
han .

12. mantile is evidently here a table—eloth. It is quite

tables (at least over costly ones) to prevent the dishes injuring
