ou THE OHRONOLOGY OF THE EPIGRAMS
(FRIEDLANDER 111. 372 Fon).

The earliest productioris of Martial extant are undoubtedly
the epigrams of the Liber Spectaculorum. This is apparently a
second edition of a collection of epigrams written for the
opening of the great Flavian amphitheatre by Titus, In this
book as we have it. published early in the reign of Domitian,
Martial appears to have retained such epigrams, originally
written in honor of Titus, as would apply equally well to
Domitian, and to have added others written expressly in
honor of the latter emperor. In one case, De Spect. iv.
and iv, b, on the delatores, it seems highly probable that he
adapted, by a slight alteration, one of the earlier epigrams to
suit Domitian. Suetonius tells us that Titus caused a number
of delatores to be fiogged, paraded per amphitheatri arenam,
and then sold or transported to islands. But Martial speaks
of the delatores as having been transported to Africa .· Tradita
Gaetulis, nec cepit arena owcentes. Now Suetonius also tells
us, that Domitian in the first years of his reign was severe
upon the delatores. Now supposing Domitian to have trans-
ported, or threatened to transport some of these peoplc to
Africa, and supposing Martial to have by him an epigram
written on Titus's treatment of them, a slight alteration of the
original of the line quoted might save him the trouble of
writing a new epigram. And this perhaps may account for the
almost ultra-Martialic exaggeration of the sentence nee cepit
ceo„ which can only mean, apparently, that the great desert
was not large enough to hold the number sent out. It can
hardly mean, simply, that Domitian’s treatment of the men
was different from Titus’s.
