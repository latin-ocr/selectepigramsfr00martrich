358 NOTES. IX. xxviii. 7-xxxi. 9.

7. domino. Domitian.

sine moribus. A compliment to Domitian for his severe
{digcts against various forms of immorality. Suet. Domit.

8. deus. Cf. rv. 1. 10.

9. vos, apparently opposed to Roma, seems to imply that
the bust or portrait was intended for some provincial town.

parasitum. Parasiti Apollinis was the name of a histrionic
colleyium or sodalitas, established originally perhaps in eon·
nexion with the Ludi Apollinares. It consisted mainly, though
not entirely, of mimi. Martial evidently adopts the term in
speaking of Latinus (who in all probability belonged to the
sodalitas), in order to introduce the antithesis between parasitus
Phoebi, and famulus Jovis. Friedlander 11. 451, n. 5, and in
Marquardt (new series), Vol. 111. pp. 517. 21, 480 n. 8. On
the collegia of the empire, see Gaston Boissier, Religion Ro-
maine, 11. 247 fol.

10. sui Iovis. The Emperor.

XXXI. Velius Paullus (Friedlander 111. 385), had vowed a
goose to Mars if the Emperor returned successful from the
Sarmatian campaign. Before eight months had quite elapsed‚
the war was brought to an end, the emperorreturned, and the
goose sacrificed. When they opened the bird, they found eight
small coins in its inside: these it had probably been made to
swallow before it was killed. An effigy apparently was made
of the bird with the coins suspended from its beak, to com-
memorate the vow and the prodigy. The goose was held in
honour among the Romans ever since the saving of the Capitol.

Livy V. 47.

3. tota. Hypallage for totos.

5. ipse. It was necessary, for the due persor-mance of
a sacrifice, that the viatim should not have to be dragged to
the altar. On this occasion the goose (probably allured by
a prospect of food) hurried up to it, and fell on the hallowed
fires, as if rejoicing to be allowed to die to celebrate Caesar’s

safety.

9. quae litat. A victim which pours silver, not blood,
to perform propitious sacrifice declares that steel is no longer
needed—that your wars are at an end.

litat, of the victim. Cf. Χ. 73. 6, ‘Non quaecunque mana
victima caesa litat.’
