300 NOTES. VI. xlvii. 1—8.

to have the power of restoring sick people to health. This was
especially the case in reference to the springs in Rome. Fron-
tinus, c. 4, after enumerating the sources from which Romans
obtained their supply of water in former times—the Tiber‚
wells, and springs—adds, “Fontium memoria cum sanctitate
adhuc exstat et colitur: salubritatem enim aeyris corporibus
afferre creduntur: sicut Camoenarum et Apollinis et Juturnae.”
Martial‚ fearing the resentment of the nymph for this intrusion
on the part of a stranger, without leave from the master (furti-
vam), vowed a sacrifice to her, if she would not visit him with
her displeasure. This sacrifice he represents himself as having
now performed, and prays that having done so, he may enjoy
the full benefit of the water, without the counteracting influ-
ence of the nymph’s displeasure. On the propitiation of
nymphs of fountains cf. Horace, Odes 111. xiii.

1, 2. domestica and tecta show that the spring was within
Stella’s house. The mention of Egeria and the Gamoenae seem
to indicate that the house was in the neighbourhood of the
Porta Capena—a town house therefore. The spring would pro-
bably be in the Peristyle 3 but see ΧΠ. 3. 12.

gemmea, ‘glittering’ with marble &c.; perhaps with a
reference to the fiowers in the hortus, cf. Pliny Ep. v. 6, prata
yemmea et florida.

subis, ‘ stealest into. '

3. Numae coniunx. The nymph is either one of the com-
panions of Eyeria, sent from the Vallis Ερενὶα, under the Cae-
lian hill, or one of the Muses whose grove and fountain were
close by. Burn, p. 218.

Triviae. The worship of Egeria was traditionally connected
with that of Diana at Aricia, cf. v. 1. 2, ‘⁶ whence it may have
been transferred by Numa to the fountain and valley outside the
Porta Capena.” Burn, 1. c. There is of course a compliment
implied to Stella in the suggestion that the nymph in his
house is one of the Muses. Nona should strictly mean Gallio-
peia3 but prob. Martial only means ‘one of the nine,' ‘a ninth,'
not ‘the ninth.'

6. bibit. In prose would prob. be subj„ as it depends on
votis.

7. tu...crimine. Excessively obscure. It is generally
explained to mean scelere expiato: and it is difficult to suggest
any other rendering, but it is by no means satisfactory.

8. secura. agrees with qaudia.
