218 NOTES. II. xxix. 8—xxx. 3.

wealth, among other waJ'S, by never appearing in the same
pair of boots two days running.

8. coccina. 11. 43. 8. The ordinary senator’s boot was
black. Hor. 1. Sat. vr. 27. It was an additional piece of in-
solence on the part of this upstart that he wore red boots, the
colour appropriated to curule magistrates (malleus).

non laesum, again very obscure. Does it mean simply
that the leather was of the very best, most supple, and easy
kind? or does it express Martial's indignation that no one

{tanssped on the upstart’s toes to punish his insolent assump-
ion.

9. stellantem ‘ shining' with the plastem, or perhaps
‘starred’ with stiymata. This man had not only been a slave,
but a branded slave. Stiymatias-stiymosus—ziteratus—notatus,
-inseriptus Letters were burnt in on the forehead to denote
the crime, e.g. Fur, Fug. :fuyitivua These letters he con-
cealed by means of Splem'a plasters, used sometimes for medical
purposeS‚ but more often for ornament, like the ‘ patches’ worn
in England in Queen Anne’s time. Perhaps the Court Freed-
men brought them into fashion. Some slaves got doctors to
efface these stiymata by surgical operation. x. 56. 6 Tristia

servorum stigmata delet Eros (a physician). Barbers also under·
took to do this. v1. 64. 26.

XXX. On a friend, who in answer to Martial's request for
a loan, gave him advice how to make money.

1. sestertia. The plural of a neuter subst. formed by
mistaken analogy from sestertium, the gen. pl. of sestertius.
1000 sesterces was either mille sestertii or sestertizim, but two or
more thousand was of course duo dcc. millia sestertium. This
came to be regarded as a neuter subst. In the earlier writers
it is only so used apparently in oblique cases of the singular
number after the numeral adverbs decies dcc„ e.g. sestertio
decies fundum emi. From Horace's time certainly sestertia
the plural=milzia sestertizim was used Hor. Epist. 1. vn. 80
dum septem donat sestertia. Viyintz' sestertia=ab0ut 5150.

3. quippe = Quiape = Quidque—introduces a conclusive
proof of the truth of some previous statement. Sometimes it
stands alone in answer to a question, and implies that the
question is assented to as obvious. ‘Of course.’ Here Martial
gives an obvious reason why it would have been no burden to
liis friend to have given the money instead of lending it, viz.
that he was a prosperous man ( felix) and an old friend.
