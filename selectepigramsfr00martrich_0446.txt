420 NOTES. XII. xxxi. l—xxxvi. 1.

1. summ, ‘arching;’ lit. ‘lying on its back‚’ that is, not
{gozing straight up on a prop but trained so as to form a

ΐῦ2. ductile. ‘ This ohannelled stream of fresh flowing
w er.’
³· Ductilis, prop. used of a substance that can be drawn or

beaten out, e.g. metals‚ is here used of water brought into the
grounds from some source outside‚ by means of channels.

3. bifero. Georg.1v. 119.

4. nec alget. ‘Is not frosted? The climate would be warm‚
and the grounds were well sheltered.

5. domestica, ⁴‘at home3’ accustomed to the pond or
viva-rium into which it had been placed.

6. candida. cf. Ovid, Trist. 1. ix. 7, ‘Adspicis ut veniant
ad candida tecta columbae? Columella vm. 8. p. 291, ‘ Totus
autem ‘locus et ipsae columbarum cellae poliri debent albo tectorio,
quoniam eo colore praecipue delectatur hoc genus avium.'

similes, i. e. candidas. Colum. 1. o. p. 292, ‘Albus (color
columbarum) qui ubique vulco conspicitur,’ διο.

8. lares. Schneidewin in ‘his second edition has adopted
this ‘emendation of Heinsius. But there is no difficulty in
understanding dapes, the reading of the best MS„ of a farm and
grounds that would supply Martial with all ⁴the requisites for
good dinners every day.

regna. Verg. Ecl. 1. 70, ‘ meareyna videns!

XXXIV. Addressed to Julius, prob. Martialis (1. 15), re·
minding him of their old friendshjp, and moralising on the
risk of trouble arising from such intimate friendships.

5. calculus. vm. 45. 2.

6. diversus, dcc. ‘ If every pebble be carried, this way or
that, to form two separate heaps of different colour.’ The two
adjectives are pmleptic, diversus signifying the separation
between the two sets of pebbles‚ and bicolor the different colours
of the two heaps, one black, the other white. There is surely
no need to understand bicolor of the colour of each pebble, and
understand three heaps, blaok‚ white, and piebald.

XXXVI. Lamnus, if he was a better patron than most of
his contemporaries, had no reason to be proud. He was only
the best of a bad lot.

1. libras. Cf. vm. 71. 1.
