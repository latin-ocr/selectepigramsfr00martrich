Imperial power had come to be hedged with a divinity
almost irrespective of the character of its representative
for the time being. It probably shocked no one when
Domitian styled himself ‘Dominus Deusque' in an
edict, or when the courtiers caught up the phrase and
rang the changes upon it. Martial, who could not
afford to be unfashionable, joined in the chorus of
