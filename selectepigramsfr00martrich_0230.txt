7. praesto. ‘1 duly present.’ Praestare, with accusative,
meaning properly to be security for another man to a certain
amount, was used secondarily in the sense of ‘making good‚’
or ‘performing the duties that a man's position entailed upon

display the courage which people have a right to expect of a
man. Here praestare togatum is to exhibit a man in a toga,

them. In the museum at York there is a funeral urn contain-
ing the bones of a lapdog. Beside the urn was found the
saucer or platter from which the animal had been accustomed
to seed. Cf. vn. 87, and Propertius v, 3.
