NOTES. VII. xxxii. 12—xxxvii. 4. 321

12. aut ubl. i.e. the Porticus Europae. Cf. 1. 108. 3.

13. fervet. The reading adopted by Schneidewin in his
last edition. With this reading, area will evidently mean the
level space of the palaestra or Campus Martius. With the
reading servit, there is a good deal to be said ior the suggestion
of Scriverius, who, comparing x. 24. 9, would translate area
here ‘ age,' ‘ men in every stage of life!

14. pigritia.. An oxymoron. Devotion to these exereises
is energetic idleness, because time is wasted, which should be
devoted to higher pursuits.

XXXVI. A request for a toga addressed to Stella who had
bffipare sent him a present of teyulae·(tiles) <for his Nomentan

2. rudis. ‘My rough farm house.;’‘0r perhaPS, rudis
means ‘new to such experienceS.'

3. effundere. ‘ carry offss’
5. December. The time of the Saturnalia.

XXXVII. On a president of a criminal court (probably
one of the Triumviri rerum capitalium, officials who certainly
continued to exist under the empire and exercised a sum-
mary jurisdiction over slaves) who signified sentence of death
to the apparitors of the court by blowing his nose. On one
occasion, while a trial was proceeding, he sorely wanted to
blow his nose, but was prevented by his colleagues, for sear of
the frightful consequences that might ensue.

Professor Conington, apparently, in his note on Persius
Π. 12, understood the allusion here to be to the Quaestor with
an army striking off dead soldiers' names from the roll (which
is undoubtedly the explanation of the line in Persius, see
Casaubon's note on the passage), but v. 4 seems hardly consis-
tent with such an explanation here.

2. theta. The initial letter of θάνατος, either the mark on
the Jurymen’s tablet signifying condemnation (the old Roman
mark was C.=condemno) used here simply for ‘sentence of
dgath3' or the mark set against dead soldiers' names. See
a ove.

novum. ‘ New fashioned.'
3. rorantem. ‘His cold and dewy nose.'

f d4. tgu’sserat. ‘Had ordered this to be considered the sign
