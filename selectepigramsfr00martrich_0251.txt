NOTES. ΙΙ. lvii. 2—5. 225

2. Amethystinatus, wearing Amethystina. Vestes Ame-
τδῖἐῃεέἰ-ηαε were the same as the Ianthinae or violaceae. See 1.

secat, makes his way through the crowd. The word is
probably intended to express conspicuousness.

Septa. Cf. 11. 14. 5.
3. Publius. Perhaps the same mentioned in 1. 109.

4. cordus, Another model of a well-dressed man, whose
speciality was his paenula. This was a sort os ponch0, an over-
garment without sleeves and with a hole merely for the neck.
It was made generally of thick strong eloth, especially oi the
kind known as qausape, and worn generally in travelling or in

wet weather. Cic. pro Milone, c. 20, ‘cum hic cum uxore γ

veheretur in rheda paenulam?

alpha. ‘A. 1 among those who wear the paenula! In v. 26
Martial apologises for calling Cordus by this name, which he
appears to have resented.

5. togatus, Cf. 1. 108. 7. Toyatus in this connexion
practically = salutator or cliens, and grex toyatus = grex clientium
officium facientium. It was part of the officium to accompany
the patron abroad, to walk before his litter if he was riding
(anteambulo). This latter term seems to have been used
generally of a client in attendance on his patron in the
streetS.

capillatus, slaves to carry the sedan: cf. Iuv. quoted above
Respicit hoc qui litiyat an tibi serv-i octo, decem comites (clientes
toyati), an te post sella, togati ante pedes. The Roman citizen wore
his hair cut short. The hair of slaves would be long or short
according to the taste of their masters The latter, if men of
fashion, seem at this time to have preferred to see their slaves,
especially the younger ones, with long hair3 in xn. 70 quinque
comati appears to be used absolutely for pueri and Petronius
speaks of slaves whose long hair was used by guests at the
dinner table as a napkin. Cf. also Seneca, Ep. 119. 14 Nam si
pertinere ad te ,iudicas quam crinitus puer, et quam perlucidum
tibi porriyat poculum, uon sitis (est). Juv. XI. 149 speaks of
his slaves as tonsi evidently in opposition to ‘the custom of the
fashionable world at Rome. Cf. also -Martial IV. 42. 7, Mol-
lesque flagellent Colla comae of a slave. Compare ΧΗ. 18. 25.
By the two adjectives coyatus and capillatus Martial evidently
expresses the two elements forming the complete yrex, the
clients and the slaves.
