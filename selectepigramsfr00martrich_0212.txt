186 N OTES. Ι. xviii. S—xxvi. 3.

8. mori, poisoned by the Vatican wine.

XXI. On the story of Porsena and Mucius Scaevola, Livy
11. 12. Possibly suggested by the scene described, v, 30.

1. satellite, i.e. the scribe or secretary.

3. tam saeva miracula, ‘ such a miraele of stern fortitude.'
for the plural miracula cf. 1. 6. 5.

pius. ‘Feeling’ the· opposite of unnatura13 pius is most
skilfully placed in juxtaposition to saeva.

7, 8. To have killed the king would have been less glorious
than to display such heroism.

XXVI. On a drunken knight who used to imbibe au the
liquor he could possibly get hold of in the amphitheatra
On the refreshments &a given in the amphitheatre see

Friedlander 11. 285. Mart. v. 49. 10.

1. subsellia.. A subsellium was the row of seats bounded
on either side by one of the viae or gangways leading to one
of the aditus or vomitoria.

2. aqua. The same quantity of water even would make

a man who was continually making new wills, that had he (the
captator) sent him beans only instead of sending, as he did,
cheesecakes every time he made his will, the expense would
have been enough to beggar a Croesus. Croeso divitior lieet
fuissem. Iro pauperior forem Charine si conchem toties (sc.
quoties placentas misi tibi tabulas siynanti) meam comesses)
For Charinus made a new will tricies in anno.

3. nomismata. This is generally understood to mean
money, and the nomisma to be a sesterce, a view which seems
to be borne out to a certain extent by the expression deciens
v 10 and bis deciens in 1. 11, an epigram on the same subject.
But, as Lessing has well pointed out, vv. 3 and 4 from this
point of view are absolutely unintelligible. If the 10 nomismata
(bis quina. 1. 11.) given to each eques were coins, they would
have been as useful outside'the amphitheatra as inside. How
then could Sextilianus have obtained the nomismata of his
neighbours in the amphitheatre? Lessing suggests with great
ingenuity that the nomismata here mentioned were not coins at
all, but tickets or tokens entitling the bearet to a certain
