NOTES. III. x. 2—xx. 4. 239

2. perque omnes dies =q·uotidie.
praestitit, ‘paid.’ Cf. 1. 108. 7.

3. premeret, ‘followed close upon.’ Verg. Georg. 111. 412,
clamore premes ad retia cervum.

4. diurna, diurnum=daily maintenance or wages. Seneca
Epist. 80. 8, diurnum accipit, in centunculo dormit.

5. ex asse, sole heir. The as and the uncia were used to
express any integer and its twelfth part. The other divisione
of the as were used accordingly. Of. 11. 1. 9.

XVI. On a shoemaker who gave a show of gladiators at

Bononia, cf. 111. 59, sutor cerdo dedit tibi, culta Bononia,
munus.- Fullo dedit Mutinae : nunc ubi copo dabit?

4. corio. There was a proverbial expression de alieno
corio ludere, ‘to take your pleasure (or gamble) at another
man's expense3 ' lit. ‘to play at the expense of another man's
hide.' Gr. corium perdere of a man being fiogged. ludere corio
suo therefore, is to take one's pleasure at one’s own expense.
Here with a sneering allusion to the man's trade, ‘you are

playing a losing game with your own leather,’ or, ‘you are
playing to lose leather yourself.’

6. in pemcula. ‘ To keep yourself within your little hide,’
i.e. not to launch out into extravagances that are above your
means; another proverbial expression, Horace, Sat. 1. vr. 22,
quoniam in proprz'd non pelle quiessem. Seneca, Epist. 9, ple-
rique sapientem submovent et intra suam cutem coqunt. The
sense of the expression here is the same as in the ‘ne sutor
ultra crepidam) There is again an allusion to the man's
trade.

of a bronze bear.

1. See 11. 14. 9, 10.

8. falsa. If it had been a real bear, the boy would not
have been killed.

XX. On Canius: cf. 1. 61. 9.

2—4. Probably a joke against Canius who would most
likely be contemplating nothing less than such a work.
