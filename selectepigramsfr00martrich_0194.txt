according to the legend, by the god himself, of the horns of

5. Mausolea. The tomb erected at Halicarnassus by Queen
Artemisia, about Β. c. 352, over the remains of her husband
Mausolus. It was discovered by Μι- Newton in 1857, and
considerable fragments of it are now in the British Museum.

pendentia. An allusion probably to the chariot group by
which the whole structure, 140 feet in height, was crowned.
Such a group at such a height might well present the appearance
of ‘standing balanced in unsubstantial air.’

Π. On the amphitheatro and other works erected on the
site of the Golden House.

1. sidereus: alludes to the starlike appearance of the head
of the Colossus (a colossal statue cf Nero which was placed by him
in the domus aurea) as altered by Vespasian. He had removed
the head of Nero, and replaced it by one adorned with seven rays
symbolically representing the sun. Martial, ΧΠ. 60, calls the
sun ‘sidereus deus‚' a phrase possibly suggested by the Colossus
which was dedicated to the Sun. Vespasian‚ when he destroyed
the Golden House, removed the Colossus, and placed it in the
Sacred Way: Dio Cassius 66. c. 15, ὅ τε κολοσσὸς ὠνομασμένος
ἐν τῇ ἱερᾷ ὁδῷ ἱδρύθη. Hadrian placed it in the entrance to the
amphitheatre‚ whence the name Colosseum or Coliseum.

2. pegmata. Pageants: wooden edifices of one or more
storeys which could be raised or lowered, made to open out and
close together again, by means of hidden machinery. They were
used in the amphitheatre in representing various soenes.
Cf. Juv. 1v. 122, and Mr Mayor's note. The sense of this line
has never been satisfactorily explained. Possibly there is an
allusion to some building connected with the amphitheatre,
where the machinery used in it was kept or made. The force
of medid vid is, that now there was a broad public thoroughfare,
where formerly had been private grounds.

4. unaque. The golden house, including buildings, grounds,
lakes, dcc. δια, extended from the palace of Augustus on the
Palatine to the gardens of Maecenas on the Esquiline, cover-ing
