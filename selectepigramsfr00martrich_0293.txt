NOTES. IV. xxxix. 6—xl. l. 267

6. Gratiana. Pliny speaking of the capriciousness of Ro-
man taste in regard to vasa arqentea says, ‘nunc Furniana
mmo Clodiana nunc Gratiana...quaerimus.’ The adjectives
probably indicate different styles of workmanship introduced
by the men (aryeraetarii Vascularii or Fabri argentarii) from
whose names the adj. are formed. These men were evidently
Italians, but at what time they flourished we do not know.

7. Callaico. The Callaici, otherwise Gallaici, were a peo-
ple of Hispania Tarraconensis, in whose country were several
gold mines, one of which was famed for the purity of the gold
procured from it. Pliny N. H. 33 ἓ 80. Cf. Martial, x. 16. 3.

linuntur, probably Chrysendeta (11. 43. 11) are meant,
Marquardt v, ii. 288, but the expression might mean silver-
gilt vessels or silvei· vessels embossed with gold. Seneca, Ep.
5. 3, amentum in quod solidi auri caelatura descenderit.

8. anaglypta. Pliny, 33 ξ 139, ‘Anaylypta asperitatem-
que exciso circa linearum picturas! Work in low relies, the
outlines of the figures &a being just raised above the general
suriace sufficiently to make it rough, lit. ‘ chiselled up.’

de mensis paternis, i. e. heir-looms.

10. purum. A play on the technical meaning of the
{13th {gg-in, not chased or embossed, and the general meaning,

XL. Postumus, now grown rich and powerful, does not
requite the faithful services of a client, rendered to him when
he was comparatively poor and powerless.

1. cum stemmate toto. ‘In undiminished majesty of
ἑῗίῑὲἕὸε ancestry stood erect’ (and ready to receive me as a

stemma appears to mean the prestige attaching to a house
boasting of illustrious ancestry. The Stemmata were the
imayines or cerae (wax masks of curule ancestors) connected
by painted lines. Juv. v111. 1, Mayor’s note3 Becker's Gallus,
