238 NOTES. III. vii. 3—x. 1.

3. balneator. I am inclined to think that the old com-
mentators, Farnabius and others, are right in understanding
Martial to mean that the centum quadrantes were paid at the
baths. In x. 70. 13, Balnea post decimam lasso centumque
petuntur quadrantes,' the intimate connexion implied by que
seems to point to the same conclusion. It was a very natural
time to pay the money, attending his patron to the bath was
the last act of the client’s officium, and payment at that time
would furnish the client with the means of paying for his own
bath and dinner. It does not of course follow from this, that
the custom of paying the sportula at the baths was universal.

The other rendering, which Mr Paley adopts, is, ‘of which
the bath-keeper used to take his share,' that is, ‘ out of which
we paid for our baths.' But it would be difficult to find a
parallel to this sense of divido without a qualifying phrase to
indicate it. The whole subject of the Baths is elaborately
discussed by Becker, Gallus p. 366 et sqq.

4. o fames amicorum. ⁶ My starving friends?

5. Regis. Cf. 11. 32. But some, comparing Spect. 11. 3,
understand reyis to mean Nero: so that the phrase would mean
‘the sportulae introduced by Nero,' which is very probable.

6. stropharum. ‘ No more fencing.' x1. 7. 4 jam stropha
talis abest,' a Greek metaphor bon-owed from the Palestra.
This verse is the supposed reply of the whole body of clients to
the question put by Martial in the previous lines.

salarium. Becker, Gallus p. 229. ‘The patrous must pay
us a fixed salary for our services, over and above dining us,
that is, they must make us an allowance in money.7 The
point of the epigram lies in the obvious hopelessness of the
demand which is represented as the only condition on which
the new arrangement ean be accepted.

salarium, lit., salt money, meant an allowance for main-
tenance, especially that granted to a provincial governor.

lam, ‘ at once.’

X. On a man, Philomusus, to whom his father, during his
life time, had made a daily allowance, amounting to 2000 ses-
terces a month. When the father died he left the son sole
heir. Martia] says that by doing so, he as good as disinherited
his son, because the latter would spend all the property in a
few days, and be left a beggar.

1. mma. Sc. sestertium. Cf. 11. 30. 1.
