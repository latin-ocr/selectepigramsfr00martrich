several reasons for ascribing to himself actions which
belong to other people. By doing SO, he avoids giving
offence, he gives life and reality to his story (a fact
well known to anecdote—mongers), he sometimes
facilitates his composition by getting rid of awkward
or impracticable names. These and similar considera·
tions apply to all epigrammatists. But in Martial's
case there is another and a special consideration to be
taken into account. He wrote epigrams to order on
lemmata furnished by his friends‘ffi. These we may
easily imagine might be required to be written in the
first person. It would be quite unsafe, therefore, to
assume that Martial speaking in the first person is
speaking about himself when what he says is out of
keeping with other statements, also made in the first
person. Now, though it is true that in several
passages in the first eleven books he speaks as a
married man, it is equally true that in other passages,
in the same books, he speaks as a bachelor and a
newly- married man. We have the choice then of two
suppositions, either that in all these epigrams he is not
speaking of himself, in other words, that they afford
no evidence of his ever having been married, or that
he was married at least four times. The former seems
far the more probable. But besides this an almost
stronger argument in favour of his not having been
married is afforded by the general tone and feeling of
the epigrams themselves. A number of incidental
indications which it would be tedious to detail, com-
bine to produce on our minds the impression that the
author of these epigrams must have been a bacheler.
To instance one such indication, it is difficult to read
Martial's addresses to newly-married friends without
receiving the impression that the writer is a bachelor.
Taking all these things into consideration, then, we
shall be justified, if not in assuming that he was
