416 NOTES. XII. xviii. 18—xxiv. 9.

18. rupta. Another reading is rapta, nominative, with
a lengthened before proxima; cf. de Spect. xxvm. 10. If
rupta is the right reading it must be intended to convey the
idea of comfortable slovenliness‚ as opposed to the irksome
primness of city life.

vestis. Explained (probably rightly) by Becker, Gallus,
Ρ. 293, to mean the stragulum covering the cathedra. In the
same page he gives a full account of the cathedra.

22. dispensat. ‘Distributes their ratione t0.’ The Vil-
licus in the country was dispensator.

rogat ponere, ‘asks to lay aside'=apparently royat ut
liceat ponere.

23. capmos. Martia] adopted city fashionsinthe country,
in having his slaves capillati (comati, criniti). Cf. Juv. xr.
149, where he prides himself on having his slaves close·
cropped in the old Roman fashion. Compare Martial‚ 11. 57.
5, and Marquardt v. i. 152. n. 891. The fashionable Romans
evidently affected young slaves with long, and sometimes
elaborately curled and dressed hair for their personal at·
tendants at dinner and elsewhere. Martial’s Vizzicua also
young, perhaps ylaber (levis), requests his master to have the
slaves' hair cut3 perhaps the long hair shocked his rustic
notions of propfiety, perhaps he had other ‚motives

XXIV. On a covinus, a gift to Martial from his friend
Aelianus. The covinum, named from the war chariot of the
British (so the essedum, the reda, the petora-itum and the
cissam? were all named from Gallie vehicles), was a light
two-wheeled carriage drawn by two horses, or mules, driven
by tlge master himself, having no seat for a coachman. Two
cou ride in it.

1. solitudo. Compare the recommendation of the driver
in xi. 38, ‘Mulio viyinti venit modo millibus, Aule. Miraris
pretium tam yrave? surdus erat.’

2. carruca. was a large four-wheeled carriage like the reda,
(Martial‚ 111. 47, 5 and 13, appears to use the two words as
synonymous)‚ intended for long journeys‚ and adapted for
sleeping in (carruca dormitoria), often elaborately ornamented
with silver (argentata).

essedo. x, 104. 7.

6, 7. rector.. cursor. x, 13. 2, 111. 47. 13.
9. Avitus. lx. preface.
