230 NOTE'S. II. lxxv.—lxxvii. 7.

LXXV. On a tame lion which turned suddenly samge,
and killed two of the attendants in the amphitheatre.

6. sanguineam. Cf. Spect. 11. It was the duty of these
attendants to rake the arena where it was moistened with the
blood of animals or gladiators, and to seatter fresh sand.

7. infelix. Either as the perpetrator of such a wretched
piece of work, or because he was killed afterwards for doing it.

LXXVII. On Cosconius, who complained that Martial's
epigrams were too long.

2. utilis, &e Probably intended to convey a double
meaning: If you are such an impatient gentleman that you
think the epigrams too long, you would be sure to see after the
greasing of the wheels if you were going on a journey3 but
Martial must mean also ‘You are just fit for such work as
greasing carriage wheels—work that requires no taste or
judgment,' the ungendis suggesting the idea of pinquis, coarse,
stupid, doltish. “

3. hac. ·With such a method of measurement as this‚’
that is, estimating things by the foot rule bodily, and not by
the harmony and proportions of the different parts.

colosson. Spect. 11.

4. puerum Bruti. A statue of a bey executed by Strongy-
lion, the Greek artist, of which Brutus was so fond that it was
named aiter him. Cf. IX. 50. 5, “Nos Bruti puerum facimus,
nos Lanyona (another statuette unknown) vivum, Tu maynus
luteum (=spiritleSS, useless), Gaura, yiycmta faci8,” to an epic
poet, who despised Martial's poetic powers because he could
only write short pieces such as epigrams.

5. Marsi...1²edon1s. Book Ι. preface.

6. duplex. ‘The same subiect is carried on into the
{eglolpd page,’ lit. a double page draws out (extends) one

tracto, here frequentative of traho simply; not used in its
more general sense of to ‘ handle ’ or ‘ treat of‚' which does not
suit the context so well.

7. longa. Martia-l says that the term ‘long‚’ that is, in
the frequent sense of ‘too long‚' is only to be applied to perfor-
mances which are encumbered with superfluous matter. Cosco-
nius’s two· line epigrams were too long because they were all
superfluous matter3 there was nothing to the point in
them.
