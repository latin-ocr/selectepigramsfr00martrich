'the secret of M'artial's success, as of Horace's (by
whom, unconsciously perhaps, he was more influencecl
than by Catullus whom he consciously imitated), lay
in the exact knowledge of his own powers. He knew
what his age was capable of in poetry, and what he
himself was capable of, and he. rigidly adhered to his
last. In a time of almost universal self-ignorance on
this subject, in a time when every poetaster wrote an
epic, when poetic composition was an accomplishment
that ‘no gentleman could be without,’ when men

And, p. 230, “ If we take the epigram in the Latin and modern
sense of the word, do all the epigram-mongers of the whole
world put together, display a tithe of his (Martial's) exuberant
wit and humour, his fancy, his perfectiori of form and style ?''
