392 NOTE'S. X. lxx. 5—10.

since Martial published his last book, and he is scarcely ready

with a new one. Martial pleads in excuse the inroads that
friendship and clientship make on his time.

5. non. There is some doubt whether nunc or non is the
right reading. The sense however in either case is clear.
Martia] says ‘ I get up before daybreak to pay my respects at a
levee.’ For nocturnus comp. x, 82. 2, ‘Mane vel a media nocte
toyatus ero‚' and J nv, V. 19 sqq. If nunc be the right reading,
resalutantes would appear to mean ‘who return my call (on
another day),' implying another inroad on Martial's leisure.
But non seems preferable, ‘who take no notice of my greeting‚'
alluding to the insolent behaviour often exhibited by the
patroni at these morning levees. Comp. Friedlander, 1. 365.
resaluto is not, I believe, used anywhere else in the sense of
‘returm'ng a call.’ The reading nunc also seems out of keep-
ing with v. 6.

6. gratulor. ‘I go to offer my congratulations'-e. g. on
birthdays, on accession to office, dxc„ &a

7. nunc... ‘Sometimes' implying different duties that
his clientship imposes on him on different days. The saluta-
tio was probably the same every day.

Dianam. It is possible that Martial means that he affixes
his seal as a witness to some document in a temple, or in the
precincts of a temple (vn. 51. 4). But Prof. Conington’s
suggestion, ‘I sign a document by moonlight,' is very attrac-
tive. Certainly he is right in understanding luciferam to
indicate the time at which the document is signed‚ whichever
translation of Dianam is adopted; ‘I go at early twilight to
sign, &cs the line referring as he says to an engagement
between the early salutatio, and the first hour.

9. reduces choreae seems quite inexplicable‚ and is very
likely corrupt. Friedlanden 1. 389. Mr H. A. J. Munro
quoted by Friedlander‚ Recensio locorum, dcc„ has most inge-
niously suggested coronae as an emendation, that is, the
crowds who thronged the tribunals of Consuls and Pmetors,
and escorted them home after the business of the day was con-
cluded. Cf. 11. 74. 1—2, XI. 24. 1. Reduces would thus be
used in a transitive sense, a force which it has in ⁶ Fortuna
redum,' vm. 65. 1, ‘Redux Iupiter’ v111. 15. 2.

10. poeta. On the recitations by poets at which they
expected their friends to attend, see (if time is no object) Mr
Mayor's note on JUV. 111. 9. If a noble or rich dilettante were
going to recite, Martial would of course be obliged to go. If a
brother poet were going to recite, it would be Martial's interest
