16. ritus Laconum. A hot-air bath at a high temperature,
after which the bather plunged at once into cold water, or had
cold water thrown over him. The name was given by the
Italians themselves. for the kind of bath was well known in
Greece, and not peculiar to the Spartans, Herodotus w. 75.
The chamber Laconicum devoted to the purpose adjoined the
smaller end of the tepidarium, or caldarium, but separate from
either. It was circular‚ with a hemispherical roof. Light was
admitted by an opening at the apex of this roof. From this
opening a plate of copper was suspended, clipeus, by raising
or lowering which the heat of the room could be regulated.
The Laconicum was of course upon suspensurae, that is, the
fioor of it was supported by small pillars, about two feet high,
forming the so-called hypocaust, an open space into which the
hot air was carried by pipes from the furnace. The baths dis-
covered at Caerwent in 1855 are said to have contained a Laco-
nicum, the floor of which was thinner than that of the other
rooms, in order to increase the temperature. Marquardt v, i.

17. cruda. ‘ Fresh.’ Not simply, ‘ not heated,' but just
as it comes from the Aqueduct. He water would be continually
running in and out, so always fresh.

18. Virgine the aqua Viryo, an aqueduct made by Agrippa
13.c. 19, so called according to Frontinus c. 10 ‘ Quod quaeren-
tibus aquam militibus puella viryuncula venas quasdam ‘mon-
stravit. It began at a distance of eight miles from Rome on
the via Collatina, and the whole length of it was fourteen miles.
It made a considerable bend to the north and entered Rome on
the side of the Pincian Hill, aud was conveyed on arches to the
Campus Martius.

Marcia. The Aqua Marcia was introduced into Rome by
Q. Marcius Rex B.c. 144. It began at a point three miles to the
right of the thirty-third milestone on the Via Valeria. The
whole length was sixty-one miles, about seven of which were on
arches. It entered the city near the Porta Esquilina, and from
there was distributed to several parts of the city, supplying even
the summit of the Capitoline. The water was considered the
best in Rome for every purpose.

21. lygdon. Cf. vr. 13. 3.

XLVII. A very obscure epigram: but the religion of it
is probably merely a vehicle for a compliment to Stella (1. 61. 4).
Martial in ill-health stole a draught from a spring in Stella’s
house. The nymphs of fountains were very commonly believed
