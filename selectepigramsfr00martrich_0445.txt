them. Later, very costly table-cloths were used, changed at
each course, and representing in tapestry work the contents of
the course. Marquardt, v. i. 321, n. 1990.

13. medios lactea. The allusion is probably to the
toral, or valance of the Triclinia. We see from Horace, Sat.
11. 84, and Epist. 1. v, 22, that this was removable, and
capable of being washed, and that it was quite distinct from the
stragulum which partially covered it. Failing everything else,
then, it would suit Hermogenes’ purpose.

14. pedes. There appear to be no data to determine the
meaning of this satisfactorily, but it would seem that the feet
of the tables were covered for sear of damage.

16. vela.. The awning over the theatre, or amphitheatro.

19. liniger-1, διο. The long linen robe, close÷shaved head,
and the sistrum were all parts of the uniform of the priests and
initiated worshippers of Isis. The sistrum consisted of a sound-
ing box resembling that of the 1 e, made of brass or precious
metals, into which were inserte loosely small bars o'f metal
bent down at the end, so as to prevent their sliding out. By
means of a handle the instrument was shaken, whereat the

vibrating motion of the bars produced a not inharmonious
sound. Guhl and Koner‚ p. 212, fig. 249.

XXXI. In praise of some groundS, prob. a villa, given to
the poet by Marcella. This lad-5⁷ is commonly assumed to have
been his wife, apparently on the strength of the use of the term
dominae alone. ,No doubt domina was used sometimes by hus·
bands in addressing their wives (Friedl. 1. 434), but that is a
very slender foundation on which to rest the assumption that this
lady was Martial’s wife3 the more so, as the term is quite as
commonly used by clients of their lady patrons. The extreme
civility displayed by Martial towards this lady points to the
latter relation rather than the former. In ep. 21 of this book
the poet addresses her in extravagantly complimentary terms:
‘⁶ Her wit and taste were exquisite and rare...The Roman palace
had only to hear her speak to claim her for its own...Not soon
would infant smile to make a foreign mother proud, more fit to
wed with Roman noble than she...She mitigated the poet's
regret for the Quem-city, her single presence turned Bilbilis
into Rome for him.'‘
