10. pm. Cf. 1. 93. It does not appear that Pudens
obtained this promotion.

LIX. On a gentleman who loved cold weather‚ because,
Martial says, in hot or warm weather he could not display his
paenulae, of which he possessed a large assortment. The pae-
nula was a long, dark-eolom·ed‚ over garment‚ made usually of
yausapum, sometimes also of skin, without sleeves and put on
over the head, through a hole made for the purpose. Gausa-
pum was a thick cloth, rough (villosum) on one side. It came
into use in the lifetime of the father of Pliny the elder. Roman
gentlemen of fashion evidently prided themselves on the make
{md material of their garments. Compare Cordus alpha paenu-

atorum. 11. 57. 4.

2. sexcentas. Of. 1. 43. 1.

4. et, ‘even.' Winter days will not suit him if they are
not cold enough to wear a paenula.

5. quid...ma11, ‘what harm have our lacernae done you?‘

lacernae. Cf. 11. 29. 4.

fmward, and more humane on your part, to wear your paenulae
in August (the hottest month in the year), since your only
object is to display them, than to wish to inflict winter on
other people, who have no paenulae to display.’

LXII. On Salamis who had become orbus by the loss of
his only son. Oppianus is a captator.

Cf 2. 3c2esgas. ‘Quicklv In with your presente, Oppianus.’
. 11. . .

3, 4. heu. “O the cruel shame! O the harshness of the
Fates‚” to deprive Salamis of his only protection against the
fortune-hunters and leave him a prey to the vultures. Seneca
Epist. 95. §43, “Amico aliquis aegro assidet: probamus. At
hoc hereditatis causa facit.- vultur est, cadaver expectat.”
‘Here is another corpse for the vultures,' says Martial‚ ‘who
will be the lucky vulture this time?’

LXIII. Another epigram against the captatores.

3. tabulis supremis. ‘Your last will and testament.’ Cf.
Horace. Sat. 11. v. 53, ‘Quid prima secundo cera velit versu)
