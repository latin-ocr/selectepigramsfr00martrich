296 NOTES. VI. xxxii. 1—xxxv. 2.

XXXII. On the suicide of Otho, generally ascribed to a
desire to prevent further civil bloodshed. Suetonius Otho c. 9.
After news of the battle of Bedriacum Statim moriendi impe-
tum cepit, ut multi, nec frustra, opinantur, mayis pudore, ne
tanto rerum hominumque periculo dominationem sibi asserere per-
severaret, quam desperatione ulla aut diffidentia copiarum and
c. 10, the words of Otho himself are given, ‘non amplius se in

is . 11. sqq.

1. dubitaret. ⁴ While the presiding Genius of civil strife
yet wavered,' had not made up her mind to which side she
should give the victory : cf. Suet. 1. c.

2. mollis. Suet. Otho, c. 12 after describing his effeminate
habits ‘⁶ Per quae factum putem ut mors ejus minime conqruens
vitae majori miraculo fuerit.''

4. certa. The suicide, as related by Suetonius and Tacitus,
was singularly deliberate.

5, 6. cato. Granted that Cato in his life was even greater
than Caesar, was he greater than Otho in his death? Cato
committed suicide to save himself from falling into the hands
of Caesar, Otho to save the lives of his fellow citizens.

XXXV. On a prosy causidicus, who refreshed himself with
water during his speech. Martial wishes that he would drink
the water out of the clepsydrae. These were the water-clocks
on the principle of hour-glasses‚ used to measure the length of
advocates' speeches. In criminal processes the time allowed
seems to have been fixed by law. In civil cases, apparently, by
mutual agreement between the advocates and the judge. The
. clepsydrae most commonly used for this purpose appear to have
been ‡-hour ones. Whether these were all of the same size

ent lengths of the hour at different times of the year, is an open
question. 1f the latter hypothesis is the true one, then the
Spatiosissimae clepsydrae mentioned by Pliny Ep. 11. 11 might be
clepsydrae adapted to the length of the summer hom-s. Differ-
ent from these were the water-clocks proper, measuring the whole
twelve or twenty-four hours, and ingeniously adapted to the
variation in the hours. See Marquardt v. ii. 37 3 et sqq.

2. arbiter. Properly a judge in a civil case involving
questions of equity as well as simple matters of fact—here pro-
bably used quite generally.
