LXXXIII. On the recall of Claudius Etruscus from exile.
This man, originally a slave born in Smyrna, began life in
Rome in the household of the emperor Tiberius. By this
emperor he was presented with his freedom, and under Caligula
he held some inferior post in the imperial household‚ accom-
panying that emperor into Gaul. Claudius promoted him to
a higher position, and under Nero, apparently, he became the
head of the imperial treasury, having entrusted to him the
administration of all the imperial revenues and expenses.
How he sared in the period between Nero and Domitian. we
do not know But in the reign of the latter he appears still as
a man of influence and great wealth (the baths described vr.
42. were probably his), and, though banished to the coast of
Campania (for what offence we do not know), he was soon
recalled. v11. 40 is an epitaph on him. There he is described
as passus utrumque deum, i.e. Domitian angry and Domitian
kind. We learn also from that, that his wife died young, and
that he himself was nearly ninety when he died. He appears
to have had more than one son. The son mentioned here who
testified his filia] affection by accompanying his father into
exile, and by his violent grief at his father’s death (v11. 40) is
addressed as Etruscus in the latter epigram v. 8.
