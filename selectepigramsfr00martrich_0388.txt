of presents. Family differences were adjusted on this day. The
name of the festival must have been derived from the Greek,
but the Romans evidently connected it with their own word

v, .

3. occurrit, sc. menti.
4. meum. ‘ My special friend.’

5. votum. My wish is to oblige two friends, but it is not
safe (by doing that) to offend a number.

Lvm. Martial dedicates a copy of his book to the nymph
of a lake (or spa?) in Umbria, to whom his friend Caesius
Sabinus had built a temple. Caesius Sabinus, a great admirer
of Martial and Turnus (a satir-ic poet of the Flavian period),
was a friend and fellow-townsman of Aulus Pudens (1v. 13).
Martial sent to Sabinus a copy of his seventh book, confident
that in doing s0, he would secure for it a wide circulation in
that neighbourhood (vn. 97). Epigram 60 of this book records
the present of a wreath of roses to the same friend. Martial
asks Sabinus to believe that they came from his Nomentane

iam, feeling sure that that fact would enhance their beauty in
is eyeS.

2. mansura, ‘lasting’
3. sic. Cf.v11. 12. 1.

4. Sassina. A town of Umbria, birth-place of Plautus, put
here for its inhabitants, Martial hopes that the charms of
this watering place will keep the Umbrians at home, and
obviate the necessity for their going to Baiae, and other more
fashionable watering places.

6. Pegasis...unda. Hippocrene, the sacred fountain of

the museS, produced by a blow from the hoof of Pegasus. Cf.
ovid, Fasti, v. 7.

7, 8. The supposed reply of the Nymph. ‘He who dedi-
cates his poems to a water nymph, indicates what fate he deems
his poems deserve.' Cf. 1. 4, ‘Do tibi naumachiam, tu das
epiyrammata nobis, vis puto cum libro, Marce, ‘natare tuo‚’ in
which Domitian is supposed to be speaking, if it is not an
epigram of Domitian’s own.

LIX. Mamurra frequents the shops, and on a false
pretence of intending to buy expensive articles criticises all
their wareS. Eventually he purchases two halfpenny cups.
