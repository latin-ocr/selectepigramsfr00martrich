vi MARTIAL.

Hispania TarraconensiS, situated on a rocky height
overlooking the river Salo which wound round the
base of the hills³‚ and famous for the gold found in its
neighbourhood, as well as for the manufacture of
steel⁴. Here lived Fronto and Flaccilla, the parents
of Martial⁵, not wealthy people, but rich enough to
give their son a good education, and cultivated
enough to give him that education at the risk of
keeping him poor all his life, rather than qualify him
by want of culture to compete with ill-conditioned
and uneducated money-getters of his time⁶. From
Bilbilis Martia] at about the age of twenty-three went
to Rome, which he reached about five or six years
before the death of N ero⁷. How he lived during the
years between A.D. 63 and the accession of Titus, we
can only conjecture. But probably he carried with
him fiom Spain letters of introduction to his great
countrymen of the house of Seneca, and by them was
introduced to the then flourishing house of the Pisosss.
Under such patronage, as a young man of considerable
ability, well educated, blest with good taste and
engaging mannerS, perhaps even then a promising·
poet, he would ‹loubtless find the means of living 111
tolerable comfort, and, before the downfall of those
great houses 111 Α.1). 65, would have gained a footing
in other influentia] families, and established himself as
the favoured client of more than one patron whose
bounty would partly support him, and whose pati-onage
would improve his credit. Brandt arguing from such
passages as 11. 30. 4⁹, where Caius an old friend from
whom Martia] wishes to borrow, advises him to
practise as an advocate, assumes that he came to
Rome with the intention of becoming a lawyer. But
such passages hardly bear this construction, and there
