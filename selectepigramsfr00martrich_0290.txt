o, .

Tyrias. Of. 11. 16. 3, 1. 53. 5.
coccinas. Cf. 11. 43. 8.

3. Galaeso. Cf. 11. 43. 3.

tepido. An allusion to the softness of the climate in the
neighbourhood of Tarentum.

4. Sardonychas. 11. 29. 2.

zmaragdos. Apparently, from the description in Pliny,
N. H. 37. §5 63—74‚ the emerald. It held the third rank
among gems in the estimation of the Romans, next to (1) ada-
mas, (2) the best pearls. It was not only used for ornament
but also to make eyeglasses or spectacles, Pliny 1. c. The
Scythian was the most highly prized variety—though Mr King
(Antique Gems) considers this and the Bactrian variety to have
been not an emerald, but a variety of sapphire. The expression
used by Pliny l.c. about Nero in Smaraydo puynas spectabat from
the immediate context would seem to mean that Nero used an
· emerald as a mirror. It seems probable that several inferior
stones were popularly included under this term.

5. dominos, ‘a hundred new sovereignS.’ dominos=aureos,
gold coins stamped on one side with the head of the emperor.
Of. Spect. xxm. 6. Gold currency at Rome began with Julius
Caesar, although gold had been occasionally coined before his
tirne: up to his time silver was the standard currency, gold
whether coined or uncoined being received by weight at a fixed
value estimated in silver coinage. Mommsen, Rom. Hist.
Vol. 1v. pt. 2, p. 553 Eng. transl.

7. glabram-ia: ‘fleeced.’

8. nudam. A play on the name Lupercus. The Luperci,
during the Lupercalia, ran naked (with the exception of an
apron of skin) through the streets of Rome. This Lupercus,

Martial sayS, will strip Chloe (of her wealth) instead of strip·
ping himself. Cic. Philipp. 11. ξ 86.

XXX. Under the form of a warning to anglers, Martial
celebrates a fishpond belonging to Domitian at Baiae. On
these vivaria or piscinae see Mr Mayor's note, Juv. 1v. 51.

They appear to have been made partly for use and partly for
amusemen .

1. lacu. On the size of these piscinae, Pliny, N. H. 18. 7.
piscinas Juvat majores (than 2 acres) habere.
