for the emperor's prowess, a skilful allusion to his supposed
victories over the Catti and Daci. In 1. 104, he attributes the
forbearance of the lions not to training‚ but to a consciousness
that they were servants of a magnanimous master ‘norunt cui
serviant leones! He deals with the same subJ’ect also in 1. 44,
1. 48, (in which he recommends the hare in case of danger to
run for safety to the lion’s mouth), 1. 51, 60.

of Hercules there. 1V. 62. 1.

2. Albula. ‘One mile beyond the lago de’ Tartari’ (about
14 miles from Rome on the way to Tibur) ‘we arrive at
the bridge which crosses the canal that drains the lakes
oi Solsatara, the ancient aquae Albulae, and carries its
sulphur-ons waters into the Teverone (Anio)...The water
