He had no business to tiespass on the great man' s time. For
Parthenius, see v. 6.

1. otiose. An indirect compliment to Parthenius con-
trasting‚ as it does, the lounging literary man and the imperial

11011 cotidiana. ‘No everyday d1·eSS‚’ meaning that the

but an ironical permission given by the poet.

5. libellos. Documents oi all kinds, including petitions,
memorials, dac. There was a special officer in the imperial

receive many such as well, especially those of a private nature.

6. aut. ‘ He has no time to bestow on the Muses, or if
he had, he would bestow it on his own (Muses)‚' a delicate com-

pliment to Parthenius’ poetic powers. For this use of aut,
ci. Horace, Odes, 111. xii. 2.
