5. clivi. ‘The clivus Suburanus of Martial‚ was the as-
cent to the Quirinal from the Subura.’ But-n, p. 80. But the
way Martia] speaks of it seems to point rather to an ascent

and vincenda of descending a slope, for heis speaking here of
the difficulties to be encountered in going from the Quirinal to
the Esquiline.
