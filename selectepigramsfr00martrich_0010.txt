water from 0116 of the aqueducts'‘''. But the emperor,
and the poet were both fully alive to the fact, that the
imperial approbation was worth money to a man who
knew how to make use of it. To enjoy the favour os
the court was to be well with the aristocracy, such
as it was, of the time, to whom the court set the
fashion in everything 5 and many a rich upstart
would no doubt gladly lay a man so well vu under
an obligation by lending him money, which it was
well understood on both sides would never be re-
paid¹⁷. More than this, the favour of the emperor
implied friendly relations with the court freedmen‚
the most influenti-al and in many cases the wealthiest
men in Rome, to whom Martial paid assiduous court.
Out of such relations a man of the world could
doubtless make capital, and a Parthenian toga¹¹3 skil-
fully handled would 110 doubt serve to stock the poet’s
wardrobe without the necessity of incurring tailors'
bills.

But Martial by no means depended on such a
precarious source of income alone. He had other more
regular, and certain means of livelihood as well. There
6611 be little doubt that he received considerable
presents from those who desired to be celebrated in
his verses. Besides this, he earned the clients'
sportulam. And his sportula would be more than the
minimum of centum quadrantes, and received from more
than one patron. For many wealthy men would be
glad to reckon a popular poet among their clientele and
for the same reason would be glad to bestow 011
him more than the usual dole. But the sportula was
not all that patrons bestowed on their clientS. Occa-
sional presents (e. 9. at the Saturnalia) and occasional
invitations to dinner formed a part of the clieut’s
remuneration‚ as regularly» expected as the sportula.
