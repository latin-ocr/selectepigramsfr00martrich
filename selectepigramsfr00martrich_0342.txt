316 NOTES. VII. xx. 11—19.

11. volvae. The womb of a sowy, like the sumen, 11. 37. 2,
considered a great delicacy by the Romans. It was served with
various condiments, possibly also stuffed.

indecens. ‘Unsightly,’ alluding to the appearance of it,
more particularly when thrust into S.’s napkin.

pellis. The outside. All the inside with the stuffing had
been eaten (excavata).

12. lippa, generally explained to mean over-ripe, with the
juice exuding through the skin, but Martial more probably
means that it had been bitten into before Santra napkinned it.

debilis certainly retains here its proper meaning of
‘maimed'- or ‘mutilatedt' the mushroom was partly eaten.
This meaning is apparent in all uses of debilis. Cf. e.g.‚ vm.
6. 8, puyna debile cernis opus. In both cases Santra is repre-
sefited as having taken a bite of the thing for appearance’
sa e.

boletus. Cf. 111. 60. 5.

14. sinu. His napkin being too full to hold any more, he
uses the fold of his toga.

spondylos. Perhaps the same as Imbria-em 11. 37. 2; orit
may be the fish of the name. Pliny 32, ξ 151.

15. devorato, like r0303, debilis, and lippa, means that
Santra made a show of eating what he pocketed. Capite is
startling‚ and suggests that either the head, or the whole bird,
must have been an imitation in paste.

turturem. Of. 111. 60. 7.
16. longa. To reach down to the floor.

17. analecta. Latin form of Greek ἀναλέκτης. The frag-
ments that fell from the table were either eaten by dogs, or
swept up by an attendant with a besom of palm-twigs.

19. mixto. Probably a double meaning is intended, not
only that the wine was mixed with water, but that all sorts of
wine were poured into this lagena. The lagena was a fiagon
of earthenware with a handle and a narrow neck widening to
the mouth. Marquardt‚ v, ii. 245.

ad. pedes. Therefore behind him, and out of sight. The
Romans lay at table on the left arm with the upper part of the
body inclining somewhat forward. Cf. 111. 23, 011 a stingy
host who sent away everything from table before the guests
had been served, omnia cum ‘retro pueris opsonia tradas, Cur
non mensa tibi ponitur a pedibus ‚²
