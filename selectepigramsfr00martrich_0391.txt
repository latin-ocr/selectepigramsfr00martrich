LXVIII. On a ludi mayz'ster, or keeper of an elementary
school. From the ludi ‘magister or literator (γραμματιστής) a
boy would proceed to a Grammaticus, and from the latter to a
rhetor. In an elementary school a boy learnt reading, wrifing,
and arithmetic: under a Grammaticus he learnt language and
literature, mainly Greek, with the Rhetor he studied rhetoric.

animals took food which was the natural food of neither of
