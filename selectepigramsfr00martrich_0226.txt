200 NOTES. Ι. lxxvi. 6—14.

6. haec sapit. She is the goddess of worldly wisdom and
bankeress to all Olympus. The construction of fenerat with
accusative of the person is apparently unique. But the emen-
dation suggested, temperat and monetae for Minervae absolutely
freezes the humour of the passage. Minerva discounting bills
for all the gods is, as Roman wit goes, a humorous idea. The
other would be tame in the extreme. The same remark will
apply to the attempt to translate fenerat deos ‘lends you all
the gods on usury' being too canny to give them for nothing.
This is not merely tame, but unintelligible.

7. hederae, i.e. the Thyrsus. Bacchus was affiociated
with Apollo, as the god who inspired poets, cf. Hor. Odes 111.
xxv. 1. Quo me, Bacche, rapis tui Plenum? and JUV. vn. 64.
dominis Cirrhae Nysaeque feruntur Pectora vestra.

Palladis arbor. The olive. The ivy bears no fruit. The
1166 of Pallas is loaded with it. Phaedrus in his fable ‘Arbores
in Deorum tutela’ (111. 17), after describing the choice made
by each of the other gods, represents Minerva, when her turn
came to choose, wondering ‘quare steriles sumerent.’ Jupiter
answers her, ‘honorem fructu ‘ne videamur vendere‚’ whereupon
Minerva chooses sagaciously the olive. Jupiter, struck with
her wisdom exclaims ‘O nata, merito sapiens dicere omnibus .·
Nisi utile est quodsacimus stulta ,qloria est)

8. varias, i.e. green one side and gray the other, cf. Ovid.
Metam. vm. 664 bicolor...baeea Minervae.

nigra prob. refers to the colour of the fruit, ‘loaded 111111 its
dark mass of fruit?

10. sophos, cf. 1. 3. 7.
11. Cirrha. The poet of Delphi, see Juv. quoted v, 7.

Permesside. Permessus was a river sacred to Apollo and
the Muses, rising in Mt. Helicon. Permessis sc. aqua, cf. v111.
{gd} Other readings are Permesside lympha and Permessidos

nuda=ino i.
13. pulpita. The platsorm from which the poet recited.

14. cathedras, ef. J uv. vm. 47 Quaeque reportandis posita est
orchestra cathedris, on which Mr Mayor says, ‘orchestra the
foremost rows immediately before the reader: 11616 1116 111016
distinguished among the audience sat, and here accordingly
the luxurious cathedrae were substituted for benches.’ There
is evidently no allusion here to the Grammarians’ chairs.
