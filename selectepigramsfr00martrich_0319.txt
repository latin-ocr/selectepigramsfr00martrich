BOOK VI.

111. On the expected birth of an heir to the empire. It
can hardly refer to the son of Domitian by Domitia because
he is represented as already dead in 1v. 3. Possibly the expec-
tation here expressed was never realised-some child or ex-
pected child of Julia‚ Domitian’s niece, with whom, after he
repudiated Domitia, he lived, is most likely referred to.

3, 4. When after a few centuries more Domitian begins to

stored the buildings on the Capitol after the fire in the reign
of Titus, but novam excitavit aedem in Capitolio custodi Iovi.
