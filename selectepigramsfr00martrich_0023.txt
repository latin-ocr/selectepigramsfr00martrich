INTRODUCTJON. xxi

veloped literary epigram, the Sinn-gedicht‚ and the
original monumenta] epigram or inscription. The
former is a short poem occasioned by some single
external object, thing, person, or incident, calculated to
arrest attention and excite curiosity. This object
corresponds in the case of the literary epigram to the
monument in the other case, which arrests the
attention of the passer—by and induces him to read
the inscription. The literary epigram, therefore,
consists of two parts, (l) the preface or description
of the occasion of the epigram, rousing the curiosity
to know what the poet has to say about it3 and (2)
the explanation or commentary of the poet, commonly
called the point. This latter part will obviously
admit of great variety and give great scope for pathos
and wit. It must of course be worth hearing, or the
reader will be disgusted at having had his curiosity
aroused for nothing. The explanation, in fact, must
be adequate to the curiosity aroused. “A Landlord

⁰ imposed upon me 3 he charged me for dear wine, and

gave me cheap,'' would be no epigram. The ex-
planation is not worth the curiosity roused. But
“a landlord at Ravenna (where good water was
notoriously scarce) cheated me: I asked for negus
and he gave me neat wine'’ is an epigram because
such a mode of cheating is so unusual and ὰ priori
improbable. The length of the two parts will depend
on the extent to which the poet desires to arouse
the reader's curiosity and the amount of explanation
necessary. But obviously in a long epigram the first
part would as a rule be the longer, and the shorter the
latter part as a rule can be made the better. In
III. 58 Martia] expends forty-four lines in praising the
villa of Faustinus, but the object is to depreciate
Bassus’s villa against whom the epigram is directed.
Similarly in VIII. 33 in couplet after couplet through
twenty-two lines Martia] describes the thin slender
