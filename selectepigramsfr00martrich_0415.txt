NOTES. X. l. 3—li. 8. 389

Glory, are all personified as presiding powers of the circus,
whose occupation is gone now that Scorpus is dead.

3. munera. In apposition to comas.

4. coronatus. Besides receiving the palm branch‚ the vie-
tzilffus charioteer was crowned with a wreath of silver or
g 6. nigros equos. An allusion possibly to the horses oi

Pluto, but the whole expression is only an artificial way of
expressing characteristically Scorpus’s departure to Hades.

7. Schneidewin's punctuation seems to be objectionable.

fuit. ‘The goal of the circus (illa) was always swiftly neared
by your car, which made the distance short: why was your

gemini rising in April.
4. Ismarium. i. e. Thracian. Verg. Ecl. π. 30.
Attica. Cf. 1. 53. 9.

5. Ravennae is perfectly hopeless. Dies Ravennae cannot
be Latin for ‘ days spent at Ravenna‚’ nor is it all probable‚
as Mr Paley assumeS, that a man would call a villa at Anxur,
‘ his Ravenna.’ qualem...Ravennam is not much more intelli-
gible. Some emendation is required. recessus (cf. ep. 58. 1 of
this book) is a very obvious one, and has been suggested.

6. quieS. Cf. X. 47. 5.
8. Anxur. v. 1. 6.
