nummis to mean sestertiis, xm. 3. 3. A cheap copy would of
course serve a plagiarist’s purpose.

copres

7. virginis chartae. Cf. 1. 39. 2.

8. inhorruit. Soiled and roughened by contact with the
hard chin, that is, worn by constant reading. There is per-
haps a play on the word inhorruit, in reference to viryinis
chartae. As to the custom of kissing the book mentioned
by most of the commentatore, there appears to be no authority
for it.

10. pumicata fronte. The frons of a roll or volume was
the end or base of it. These endS, when the book was finished,
were carefully levelled and smoothed with pumice stone, and

dyed black.

11. umbilicis, used here, and elsewhere in Martial to
express what Ovid Trist. 1. 1. 8 calls cornua, that is, the
knobs inserted in the hollow ends of the reed round which the
book was rolled. These were partly for ornament, partly to
hold the book in reading. Umbilici strictly meant the hollow
ends of the reeds themselves, in the same plane with the frontes,
Martial only once uses the word cornua in this sense of knobs,
XI. 107. 1. Explicitum nobis usque ad sua cornua librum. In
the singular, umbilicus means the stick itself 11. 6. 11.

membrana. The parchment cover in which the roll was
wrapped to preserve it. This was elegantly dyed, generally
purple. Martial calls it purpurea toya x. 93. 4. It corre-
sponded to our ‘binding'

14. ¹ silentium. Secresy on the author’s part.

LXVH. A play on the word liber. In the first line it
means ‘Free spoken‚’ in the second, ‘Free from business or
work,' ‘with plenty of time to spare.’

LXIX. On Canius, see 1. 61. 9.
