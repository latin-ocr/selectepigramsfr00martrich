epotavere, a rather striking way of expressing what would

4. The toga was the dress required by Roman etiquette at
the public spectacles. Augustus insisted upon it and allowed
no other garment to be worn over it. Suet. Aug. c. 40 ηερο-
tium aedilibus dedit ‘ne quem posthac paterentur in foro eircove
nisipositis lacernis togatum consistere. Domitian appears to
have allowed an upper garment but to have insisted upon its
being either white (xiv. 37 ‘Albae lacernae .· ’ amphitheatrales nos
commendamur in usum cum teyit alqentes alba lacerna togas) or
at least of one colour, viz„ either purple or scarlet. v. 8,
xm. 131. His immediate predecessors appear to have allowed
spectators to appear in various coloured garments‚ V. 23 Her-
barum fueras inclutus, Basse, colores Jura theatralis dum siluere
loci.

7. lunata.. The Senators’ boots came higher up the leg
than the ordinary ones, were fastened by four thongs and bore
a crescent in front. Becker's Gallus, p. 426, 1. 49. 31 Lunata
nusquam pellis, speaking of the pleasures of country life.

lingula, probably a portion of one of the thongs (corrigiae),
which, after being carried round the ancle, was passed longitu-
dinally through the others down the front of the foot. See

drawing in Becker 1. c. Linyula here is put per synecdochen
for the whole boot.

non hesterna.. These words are very obscure: the only
