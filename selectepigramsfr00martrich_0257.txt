LXXXV. Martial sends a summer present to a friend at
the Saturnalia, and tells his friend that he may send him a
summer-present in return.

1. custodia. A glass vessel enclosed in wickerwork to
hold, or perhaps to make cocta in. Cocta sc. aqua was water
first boiled, then poured into a glass vessel‚ and plunged in
snOW. Boiling the water was supposed to make it more whole-
some, and to make it capable of a greater degree of cold.
decoquere is the more usual word for this process. Pliny N. Η.

Tempore, consumptum J‘am cito deficiet)
