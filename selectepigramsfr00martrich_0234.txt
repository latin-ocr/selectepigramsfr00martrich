208 NOTES. II. PREF.-i. 5.

an=here utrum amum. In the best Latin writers an alone
after nescio, δια, implied the mental rejection of other alterna·
tives and the statement of the one to which the speaker in-
clines3 so that ‘nescio an hoc ita sit: ‘I am inclined to think
this is the case,’ but later writers used it as it is used here.

So even Horace, Odes 1V. 7. 17 Quis sit an adjiciant hodiernae
crastina summae Tempora Di superi.

10. inter mos. So. spectatores. Keeping up the metaphor
of the proverbial expression just used—I sit in that part of the
amphitheatre where the people protest against such uneven
fighting as a mirmillo armed only with the rudis fighting a
retiarius fully equipped. Taken out of the metaphor it means,
‘ I strongly advise you not to have recourse to such a feeble

protection as ‘a prefatory epistle when you have such a powerful
weapon as epigram writing.'

11. Puto begins Martial's reply to the supposed expostula·
tion of Decianus.

12. quid. Sc. dieas. ‘If you only knew what a letter and

what a long letter you were going to be troubled with !’ but for
your expostulation.

13. negotium habere, ‘ to have dealings with.'
fueris habiturus. Lit. ‘You have been about to have)

14. tibi, ‘ to your advice!
On Decianus see 1. 39. 6, 61.

h It 1. An address to his book, congratulating it on being
s or .

b 3. at nunc. ‘As it is' opposed to what it might have
een.

succincti properly means ‘wearing a short or tucked-up
garment.’ So active, quick, because unemumbered, x11. 24.
succinctus cursor.- here it means concise, succinet, in our
sense, short, having nothing superfluous in it. So Pliny
speaks of trees as ‘Graciles succinctioresque,’ i.e. having no
superfluous wood about them. N.H. XVI. 10.

5. librarius. Sc. scriba or servus ‘The transcriber‚’ one
of the publisher's staff of slaves, This line is important as
showing the speed with which these men worked. The second
book contains nearly 550 lines.
