NOTES. VI. xlvii. 8—lviii. 7. 301

sit, ‘may I have drunk to my health.' This seems to be
an adaptation of a social formula in drinking to a person.

LVH. On a curious device of a baldheaded man to conceal
his baldness. He used coloured pomade to produce an ap-
pearance of hair on the bald part. Martial tells him that he
would never require a barber—a sponge at any time would
shave his head. So also, vr. 74, he speaks of a man ‘calvam
trifilem semitae-tus ‘unguenta’ where the best reading is ‘semi-
tatus‚' i.e. with walks of coloured pomade between the wisps
of hair on his bald head.

LVIII. To Aulus Pudens, a centurion and friend of Mar-
tial‚ to whom the latter addresses several epigrams, now serving
against the Daci, cf. tv, 13.

1. Parrhasios. Cf. IV. xi. 3. From the connexion with
the bear it came to be equivalent to Northern.

triones, sc. septem. The seven stars of the great bear. In
Verg. Aen. 1. 744, Trio is used of the whole constellation. On
ἷξοῖ ἭοῙοςγ of the word, see Max Miiller, second series,

2. GeticizDacici. Getae was apparently the Greek ap-
pellation of the people known to the Romans as Daci. Meri-
vale. R. E. c. 61. It appears to have been used of the Sar-
matians as well, IX. 45. 2.

3. Martial had been dangerously ill. He seems never to
have enjoyed continuous good health in Rome, cf. vl. 47 and
70, where he says of himself, in contrast to a man of 60, who
had never known a day’s fflness and defied the doctors, ‘at
nostri bene computentur anni, et quantum tetricae tulere febres,
aut lanquor gravis, aut mali dolores a vita meliore separentur,
Infantes sumus et (and yet) senes videmur) That is, if his
years were rightly reekoned‚ and all the time wasted by illness
subtracted from what could fairly and properly be called life,
(as he says further down, ‘Non est vivere sed valere vita est, ')
he would be found an infant in life, though an old man in
years.

quam paene. Cf. Horace Odes 11. xiii. 21.

5. quamvis», ‘tired and weary as they were.’

7. si, dcc. i.e. if the future in store for me is not a very
gloomy one, and the gods are not deas to my prayers, we shall
both live to meet on your return3 the nature of his life being
expressed by the eolour of the threads spun by the Parcae.
