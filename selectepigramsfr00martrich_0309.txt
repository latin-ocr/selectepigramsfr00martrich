NOTES. V. xix. 3—xxii. 4. 283

3. triumphos. Cf. v, 3.

4. quando. ‘When did the gods of the Palatine (more
especially connected with the imperial house) ever deserve
better at our hands,’ than by contributing to all the glories of
your reign ἴ) Or is Dei meant sor the emperors themselves?

10. non alienus=suus--‘ a knight of his own making)
That is, one on whom he has conferred a knight's fortune.

11. saturnaliciae‚ &c. ‘A spoon of a Saturnalician half
pound’ means more than simply a silver spoon of {e pound
weight sent at the saturnalia: the adj. is evidently meant to be
disparaging: the {2- pound was no doubt in keeping with the
enforced Saturnalian presente, (in which people seem to have
studied how little they could give without seeming to be very
mean), either scanty in weight, or of inferior silver, ‘ a Brum-
magem halfpound gift-spoon.’ The liyula was a larger spoon
than the cochleare. vm. 71. 9, 10.

12. flammarisve togae. The only thing certain about
these words seems to be that Martial never could have written
them. Lamnalis cotulae, the conjecture of Heinsius, is pro·
bable. Friedlander suggests Flammantisve auri.

The scripulum auri was a small gold coin, value 20 sesterces.
Pliny, speaking of the relative value of gold and silver coinage,
says: 33. ξ 47: Aureus nummus percussus est, ita ut scripulum
valeret vicenis sestertiis. There are several specimens of the
coin in the British Museum. As a weight, the scripulum was
ᾗ of an uncia. Cf. 1v. 88. 3.

tota, ironical.
13. luxuria est, ‘is reckoned extravagance.'

14. aureolos—‘ who rattles out a few paltry sovereignS.’
The aureas=1oo sesterces, Τ11θ diminutive is contemptuous.

XXII. An apology to Paulus for not calling upon him.

1. mane, the salutatio. Of. 111. 36. 3.
2. Esquiliae, i.e. your house on the Esquiline.

3. pilae, some column in the vicinity of Martial’s lodgings,
otherwise unknown. ⁷

temple dedicated to Jupiter, J uno, and Minerva, the three spe-
cial deities of the Capitol, stood on the Quirinal. Comp. 1. 2.
