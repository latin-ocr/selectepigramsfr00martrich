nee cepit, ‘could not hold them.'

arena, the great desert. An exaggeration very much in the
style of Martial. But see Appendix I.

IV. b. An incomplete epigram on the same subject.

2. impensis. impensa, sc. pecunia, properly means money
expended on something3 so expense incurred. It is here used
simply for benefits conferred. Horace uses the word in a
sense approaching to this but still implying the notion of
pecuniary outlay, Epist. 1. 19. 37, ‘Non eqo ventosae venor
suffragia plebis, Impensis ooevnarun et tritae munere vestis?

V1. and VI. b. Two incomplete epigrams on the subject of
women fighting in the arena. Cf. Juv. 1. 22. Under Nero,
women as well as men of high rank were forced to fight in the
arena, though some did so for their own amusement. Dio
Cass, 61. c. 17, καὶ ἄνδρες καὶ ’γυναῖκες οὐχ ὅπως τοῦ ἱππικοῦ ἀλλὰ
καὶ τοῦ βουλευτικοῦ ἀξιώματος ἐς...τὸ θέατρον τὸ κυνηγετικὸν
εἰσῆλθον.. ,ἵππους τε ἤλασαν, οἱ μὲν ἐθελονταὶ οἱ δέ καὶ πάνυ ἄκοντες.
Under Titus only women of lower rank acted in this way. At
the dedication of the amphitheatre 9000 animals of various
kinds were slaughtered (5000 in one day), partly by women.
Dio Cass. 66. o. 25, Suet. Titus c. 7. Domitian possibly followed
Nero’s example in forcing women into the arena, but the
authorities quoted by Mr Mayor on JUV. 1. 22 are not conclu-
sive as to the compulsion. Dio Cassius only says that
Domitian matched women against dwarfs, and Suetonius that
he exhibited combats of women. There were evidently at all
times plenty of women like M aevia, who took to the business
kindly. The probability is that Titus forbade any but women
of the lowest class to fight in the arena, and that Domitian
allowed any, who liked, to do 80.

IX. On a rhinoceros in the amphitheatro which in an
unexpected burst of fury tossed a bull. Spect. xxu. is on a
similar subject. There it is a bear that is represented as
having been tossed. The rhinoceros was a two-horned one,
an animal the first appearance of which in Rome is com-
memorated on coins of Domitian. Friedl. 11. 530. Figures
of this celebrated animal were given as apophoreta, XIV. 53,
‘Rhinoceros’ ‘Nuper in Ausonia domini spectatus arena, Hic
erit ille tibi, cui pila taurus erat.'
