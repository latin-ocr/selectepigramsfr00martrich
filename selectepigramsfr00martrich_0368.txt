3. plebe deorum. Cf. Ovid, Ibis 81, ‘vos quoque plebs

Semideumque θετικῶς]

5. laurus. Cf. Suet. Domit. c. 6, ‘de Sarmatis lauream

9, 10. People had expected only a hasty slight meal, or
perhaps a dole to be carried away, but found themselves re-
galed with a full banquet on a grand scale.

sportula is here either simply a dole of viands, or such
a meal as those given by Claudius, when he gave out that,

‘ velut ad subitam condictamque coenulam invitare se populum,‘
Suet. Claud. c. 21.

Cf recta, sc. coena. The full dinner complete in all its courses.

LI. On a phiala (patera, cf. vm. 33. 2), the gift of In-
stantius (or Instans ?) Rufus to Martial. From the similarity
of vv, 9, 10, to Juvenal 1. 97, some of the commentatore have
decided that the bowl there alluded to is to be the same as
this bowl. The probable material of the cup has given rise
to some discussion. Lessing arguing that VV. 3 and 4 would
be a most unnatural way of expressing the genuineness of
metal supposes the material to have been some sort oi precious
stone, e. g. crystal of some kind. He understands vera electra
to mean simply amber‚ the original substance, as it were,
from which the metal electrum was named. vv. 3 and 4,
therefore, he explains thus: that composition made to imitate
precious stone would be detected by being exposed to beat,
by being held before a fire. ‘It is true that a real precious
stone will bear a higher degree of heat than any sort of
composition.' Nubila he takes to indicate the actual condition
of the stone (the negative being confined to odit), “ a fine sort
of stone allowing the light in all its parts to pass through it
in an equal degree, as if seen through a mist, and having no
denser spots, when it is opaque '‘ (nulla caliyz'nefusca livescit).

The weak point in his argument appears to be the explana-
tion οἱ vera, which certainly seems to point to some sort of
electrum as the material, or part material of the cup. The
view usually accepted is that the vessel was made of the metal
electrum, or partly of that, and partly of silver.
