Suet. Dom. c. 5. See Burn R. and C. pp. 135, 136, where he
shows that the ruin commonly called the temple of Minerva was
connected with the Forum Nervae. It has been supposed that

post, that is from Martial’s house which was on the western
slope of the Quirinal 1. 108, 3.

The district indicated by Martial is the Argiletum con-
taining the Paternoster Row of Rome. It lay behind the build-
ings on the N. E. side of the Forum Romanum, extendjng from
the N. E. corner to the Suburra.

On the Fora of the emperors Mr Burn says as follows.
“Each had its temple in the centre of a walled. court, sur-
rounded with portiooes....The tribunals were placed and the
court of justice held, either in the temples or in the semi-
circular Apses, which, if we may conjecture from the remains of
the Forum Augusti, projected from the outer wall. The offices
of business for bankers, notaries, government officials, or
merchants were under the arcades which ran round the court.'

ΙΙΙ. An address to his book in the manner made popular
by Horace I Epist 20, ovid Trist. 1. 1, and others. ‘You will go‘
says Martial ‘to the publishers and through the ordeal of
public recitation (the regular mode of introducing literary
works to the literary world at Rome), but you little know what
awaits you. They will treat you like men treat one whom
they desire to toss in a blanket‚ They impose upon him with
fiattery and cajole him into believing that they are his good
friends and wish him no harm, and then, when on some
pretence or other they have induced him to get on the blanket‚
they toss him. So they will flatter you with a sophos or two,
and when you, poor fool, think you have reached the height
of your ambition, you will find that they have only been
making fun of you all the while.’ Martial may intend a
side-blow at the insincerity of most of the applause at reci-
tatione.
