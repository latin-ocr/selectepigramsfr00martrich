394 NOPES. X. lxxiii. 3—lxxviii.

Apicius. The most luxurious man of his age. 111. 22.

4. Maecenas. Cf. J nv, x11. 38, 39, ⁴ vestem Purpuream teneris
quoque Maecenatibus aptam‚’ and Mr Mayor’s note on 1. 66.

eques, Cf. Horace, Odes, 11. xvi. 20.
6. quacumque=quavis. 1. 41. 18. litat. Cf. 1x. 31. 9.

17. a te. Therefore it is valued even far above its intrinsic
va ue.

possem. ‘Could 1 have failed to like your gift I could
have found pleasure in seeing my own name.’ The similarity
of the names of Martial and the giver 01 the toya added a
charm to the gift. Professor Conington would understand
nomen meum 01 Martial’s name embroidered on the toga.

10. iudicium in a pregnant sense, ‘ The good opinion.’

LXXVII. On Carus who died very rapidly of sever. Not-
withstanding the assumption of all the commentators, it is
pretty evident from the epigram that Carus was not a doctor.

Maximus very possibly was.

2. illa. The sever, which in the natural course should
have turned into a quartan, cf. Juv. 1v. 57, ‘jam quartanam
superantibus aegris‚' when the cold weather gives patients hope
that their disease will assume the milder form.

4. servari. If ille is the right reading Martial must intend
a double or perhaps triple emendo-e. His words might mean
that the patient ought to have been saved 101· his physician to
heal, that is, that the physician had not had a fair chance to
use his skfll, or that he ought to have been saved to swell his
physician’s bill, or lastly that he ought to have been saved 101·
his physician to kin, that the rapidity 01 the sever did not give
the physician a chance of blundering. But more probably illa
is the right reading, meaning the saeva nocens febris as opposed
to the quartam Carus should have recovered, at least so far as
to find himself affiicted only with the milder disease, the
virulent malady should have been kept (after Carus had done
with it) for the physician, who pretended to cure such ailments
(suo) and failed in this case to do so. Prof. Conington suggests
that if it could be established that Carus was a curer of
Quartans, we might restore illa in v. 4, and sanari instead of

servari.

LXXVIII. To Macer on his departure as propraetor to
Dalmatia. Macer had before this been curator 01 the Appian
way. x, 17, ‘Mensorum lonyis sed nunc vacat (has only
