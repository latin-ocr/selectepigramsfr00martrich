Horace Odes 111. v, They had also been canonised after death
(Divus). And this feeling increased as their power grew more
absolute. The Flavian family especially were all regarded with
superstitious reverence (esp. by provincials)‚ but Domitian was
the first apparently who assumed a divine character by allowing
himself in a public document to be styled Dominus deusque
moster, a phrase repeated by Martial, vm. 2. 6, v, 8. 1.

IL and 111. Two epigrams suggested by a snow storm during
an exhibition in the amphitheatra One on a man who, dis-

pl. often used of a single garment). Cf. 11. 29. 4. The other

show unmoved. Dio Cassius reports very different behaviour
on his part ata naumachia, when a storm came on. ὑετοῦ

8. pueri. The only child of Domitian, who died young,
and was, of course, reckoned to have been enrolled among the
number of the gods. A coin has been found with the child's

snowstorm was a piece of play on the part of this child at his
father's expense.
