NOTES. X. xxxi. 6—-xxxvii, 1. 383

’ caput. The chief dish. Cic. Tuscul. V. xxxiv. 98.

6. hominem. Compare the same expression used in a
different sense in ‘the'Antiquary‚’ c. XI. “It's no fish ye’re
buying: its men’s lives.’'

XXXV. On the poetess Sulpicia, who wrote erotic and
witty verses addressed principally to her husband Calenus.
This is of course quite a different lady from the Sulpicia of
Tibullus. Two lines from her poems are quoted hythe Scho-
liast on JUV. v1. 537. The satire published as hers, and
appended sometimes to editions of Ausonius, Petronius, and
Juvenal, sometimes published separately, is generally con-
sidered to be spurious, and is very probably the productiori of
some 15th century poet. Teuffel, 11. 135. According to Mar-
tial‚ here, Sulpicia would have nothing to do with stories of
impure loves, but wrote chaste love verses, full of life, spright-
liness, and wit, but free from impurity. Her sportive effusions
were such as those Egeria might have charmed Numa with in
their leisure momentS. Sappho might have been improved
both in style and modesty had she enjoyed the privilege of
associating with Sulpicia. Phaon would undoubtedly have
made love to the latter, but to no ‘purpose3 for even a god
could not induce her to live apart from her Calenus.

7. Byblida. Ovid, Met. 1x. 454.
nec. Ne quidem.

8. docet. ‘Tells the world of.’ Used partly perhaps as
Horace uses it, Odes 11. xix. 3 partly with reference to the moral
instruction people are supposed to derive from reading Sul-
picia's verses.

Docere fabulam is really a different use of the word.
9. delicias, dcc. ‘ Charming badinage.'

11. sanctiorem. Cf. vn. 17. 3.

12. nequiorem. Cf. 1. 109. 1.

18. durus. To Sappho.

XXXVH. Addressed to Maternus, a countryman of Mar-
tial's‚ and leading advocate, or perhaps juris-consult at Rome.
Martial, by way of announcing his own departure for Spain,
indirectly extols that country in comparison with Italy. The
key-note of the satire is in v, 19.

1. iuris. The whole body of common law.
sanctissime. ‘Most conscientious.'

legum. Special laws.
