220 NOTES. ΙΙ. xxxii. 7—xxxvii. 5.

7. non bene. ⁴ It is not pleasant, I assure you, to serve a
servant-friend.’ Cf. vicarius 11. 18. 7.

servitur, a sort of play on the word Dominus, which, like
fieaggwtjts the appellation insisted on by rich patrous. Cf.

XXXVII. On a curious custom among the Romans of
carrying off eatables from the dinner-table in the napkin. In
this case it seems to have been done without disguise, but the
poor gourmand Santra in vn. 20 did the same thing by stealth.
Probably a rich guest could do with impunity what a poor one
could not, and wealth was no more then than now incompati-
ble with meanneSS.

2. mammas suminis. The breast of a young sow was a
favorite dish among the Romans.

imbricem. Some part of a pig resembling an imbrex, a
hollow tile used in roofing houses. Facciolati understands the
ear, others the ribs, others the chine, the vertebrae bearing
some resemblance to tiles overlapping one another—but the
plural would be expected in these two last cases.

3. communem. ‘Intended for two,' or ‘of which some
one else had taken part.’ ·

attagenam, a bird which was considered a great delicacy—
perh. the heathcock. XI. 61. Inter sapores fertur alitum
primus Ionicarum §ustus attagenarum.

4. mullum. The mullet. A very favorite and, if large,
expensive fish among the Romans. Large ones sold for more
than 1000 sesterces a pound. JuV. IV. 15, mullum sex millibus
emit aequantem sane paribus sestertia libris.

lupus. A commoner fish, but varying very much in
quality. Those caught between the two bridges--the pons Sub-
licius and the pons Senatorius-were considered the best. Hor.
11. Sat. ii. 31, and Orelli’s note.

5. muraenae. A kind of sea eel. The best came from
the coast of Sicily and Tartessus. Juv. v. 99. Virroni muraena
datur quae maaeima venit Guryite de Siculo. They were kept
by rich Romans, who made ponds for the purpose, but this
apparently was more for amusement than for eating‚—as carp
have been kept in later times.
