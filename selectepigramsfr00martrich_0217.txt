N OTES. I. xliii. 1—8. 191

1. bis triceni. From the number invited and the style of
the dinner, we may conclude that it was one of those quasi-
official dinners given by great mento their cliente, an occasional
invitation to which was part of the payment for the services
rendered. Such a dinner is described in the fifth satire of
Juvenal. Generally in these cases the triclinium of the host
which he occupied with a few friends of his own degree, was
served quite differently from the other triclinia where the clients
were.

Bis triceni, an indefinite but large number. cf. 111. 26. 1,
‘sexagena teras cum limina mane senator,’ so 600 is used where
the larger multiple is required to express magnitude relatively
to the thing spoken of, 111. 22. 1, ‘ Dederas Apici bis trecentiens
ventri.' So also 300 sometimes. Horace Odes 111. iv. 80.

2. aprum. One boar apparently for all the triclinia.

3. non quae. Grapes allowed to hang on the vine till
winter, and dry naturally, different from artificially dried raisinS.
Juv. ‚XL 71, ‘servatae Parte anni quales fuerant in vitibus
uvae.

4. melimela. ‘PippinS.’ Horace Sat. 11. viii. 31.

5.. genesta. Pears were ripened and preserved as now, by
being hung up by the stalk. Genesta is broom twisted into
strings for the purpose.

6. Punica grana. The pomegranate which is eaten by
sucking the seeds of it.

imitata. Simply alluding to the colour of the inside of the
fruit. Breves is a constant epithet of rosae.

7. metas. Cf. 111. 58. 35, ‘metamque lactis Sassinate de
sylva) Sassina in Umbria probably is meant. The metae
were cheeses of a conical or cylindrical shape so called from
their similarity to the metae of the circus,

8. Picenis. Picenum was famous for its olives and
apples, Of. v11. 53. 5, cum vimine (a hamper or perhaps jar
covered with osier work) Picenarum.

The raisins, apples, pearS, pomegranates and probably
the cheese would belong to the mensae secundae. The olive both
to the „qustus and the mensae secundae. Martial means that the
most ordinary table luxuries were not served at Mancinus’s
table. The articles which he notices as absent are mentioned
