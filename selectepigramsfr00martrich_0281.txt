NOTES. IV. i. 3-7.

BOOK IV.

Ι. See Appendix Ι.

3. longa. Comp. Milton, Ode to May. ‘ Thus we salute
thee in our song, and welcome thee and wish thee long.'

numerosior. Lit. ‘ more numerous than the age of Nest0r‚’
i.e. ‘ May thy returns outnumber the days of Nestor‘s life)

5. Albano. Suet. Domit. c. 4, ‘ Celebrabat et in Albano (in
his palace near Alba) Quinquatria Minervae. ..eximias venationes
et scenicos ludos, superque oratorum ac poetarum certamina!

multus. Used of repeated action: ‘ often‚' ‘for many a year. ’
Cf. Sallust, Jug„ in operibus in aqmine ad viyilias multus adesse.

in auro. Not ‘dressed in,' or ‘crowned with gold‚' but ‘en-

ladio tua [Domitian’s] me manus induit auro') as opposed to

Capitoline contest. The words of Suetonius, ‘capite yestans
coronam auream,’ quoted by Mr Paley, apropos of this expres-

dent of the Capitoline contest, not of the Alban. But this line
is evidently an allusion to the latter celebration, as the next
line is to the former.

6. Suet. Domit. c. 4, ‘Instituit et quinquennale certamen
Iovi Capitolino triplex, musicum, equestre, yymnicum, et ali-
quanto plurium, quam nunc, coronarum. Certabant enim et
prosa oratione Graece Latineque‚' dcc. See on the whole subject

7. Suet. 1.c. ‘Fecit et ludos saeculares, computata ratione
temporum ab anno non quo Claudius proxime sed quo olim
Auyuetus ediderat!

ingenti lustro. According to some Roman authorities 100,
according to others (the Quindecimviri sacrorum) 110 years.
Under the empire neither the one interval nor the other seems
to have been observed. Augustus celebrated the secular games
