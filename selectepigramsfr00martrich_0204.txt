PREFACE .

1. temperamentum, ‘happy mean’ a nice adjustment of
different parts.

3. personarum, persons or individuals, as opposed to
things. Here the persons or individuals possessing the vices,
foibles, peculiarities, δια, attacked by Martial, as opposed to
the vices, fomes, &a themselves.

Persona. meant: (1) amask; (2) acharacterinaplay. From
this latter meaning were derived: (3) the meaning of a false
character assumed to impose upon others, e.g. Hie finis Appio
alienae personae ferendae fuit: suo jam vivere ingenio coepit.
Livy 111. 363 (4) of the part played or the character sustained
(in a good sense) by any one, e. g. Qui philosophiam profitetur
yravissimam videtur sustinere personam. Cic. in Pison. c. 29;
(5) of the person representing a certain class or type of
character, e.g. In ejus modi persona quae minime in jztdiciis
periculisque tractata est. Cic. pro Archia, e. 11. In legal
phraseology persona was opposed tores, the person or individual
representing legal rights of one kind or another. Hence our
word ‘parson‘, i.e. persona ecelesiae, the individual who
represents the rights of the Church in a parish.

For the statement comp. vn. 12. 3, and x. 33, where
he appeals to Munatius Gallus, the old man as sweet-tempered
as Socrates, “si viridi tinctos aerugine versu-3, Forte malus
livor dioeerit esse meos...a nobis ethicas, (disclaim them on
my behalf) nec strinqere quenquam Talia contendas carmina,
qui ἱερέων, (and maintain that no popular author attacks with
such verses as those, (metaphor from drawing a sword‚ or
perhaps, cognate construction ‘writes such wounding, offensive
verses’)) Hunc serrare modum nostri novere libelli, Parcere
personis, dicere de vitiis.''
