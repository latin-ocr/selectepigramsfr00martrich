botellos. Black puddings, made with the blood of animals,
differing therefore from tomacula, sausages. 1. 42. 9. They
were servecl with white sauce, or perhaps on pastry of some
kind, v. 78. 9, et pultem niveam premens botellus.

14. cybii. 111. 2. 4.

maenas, a small cheap fish.

15. cellarius. We have no information to explain this
passage. The Cellarius, so far as we know, had nothing to do
with cooking the dinner, but was responsible for the cellar and
lauder, rendering account of each day's consumption to the
dispensator, Inthe country he appears also to have distributed
their rations to the slaves. It is just possible that in this case
the cellarius was also cook‚ but not likely. Capellianum is
apparently some dish named after a man, but what, we do not
know. Apicius mentions several dishes evidently named after
individuals (e. g. Apicianum) but not this one.

18. gabatas. vn. 48. 3.

parapsides, or paropsides, properly, a small quadrangular
dish, used to place beside the centre dish. ΣΙ. 27, Martia]

speaks of Hallec, a kind of fish sauce in a paropsis of red
(Samian‘z) ware. But the word appears to have been used
generally to denote any dish or platter. St Matth. xxiii. 25,
Juv. 111. 142. In the sense of a side-dish it is used metaphori-

20. lautum, recherche, venustum, tasteful.

21. ponere. A play on the two meanings of the word ‘to
put on the table,’ and ‘to spend.’ Comp. 1. 43. 13—14.

XXXHI. In honour of the green faction in the circus
(cf. x. 48. 23). This faction, the one that Martial affected, is
vindicated from the suspicion of unsair support from the
deceased emperor, by the fact that they have won more vic-
tories since his death than in his lifetime. Friedlander's sup-
position that Domitian is meant here by Nero (comp. Juvenal
xv, 38, Calvo Neroni) is surely right. Stobbe's theory that this
epigram was written originally soon after Nero’s death, and
produced now for the first time by way of suggesting to people
