quantity of wine, (tesserae vinariae); on this supposition vv, 3
and 4 become intelligible at once. The nomismata would be of
no use out of the amphitheatre‚ and therefore knights not given
to drinking might naturally hand over theirs to Sextilianus,
or, what is still more probable, needy knights might sell them.
nomisma is generally used no doubt of a piece of money but
the leading idea of the word is a token or a piece of metal
stamped in a certain way. Prudentius uses it of the image on
a coln.

deciens probably means deciens centena millia 1000000-0f
course a piece of humorous exaggeration on the part of the
poet-but it is quite intelligible that Martial speaking of these
tokens might use language properly applicable to the reckoning
of money, or he may mean by deciens tickets amounting in

“ value to 1000000 sesterces, Tickets were used for the purpose

of distributing presents in the amphitheatre. Suet. Domit.

vicina, as ulteriora in the next line, is used by hypallaye for
vicinorum.

4. cuneis. A cuneus in the amphitheatre was the whole
number of seats bounded above and below by a praecinctio (an
elevation running all round the circle and dividing the tiers of
subsellia) and on each side by a via. Besides the distinction
of senators’ and knights’ seats the cunei populares were ap-
propriated to different classes: e.g. soldiers and married men
had special cunei assigned to them. The viae ran from one
praecinctio to another not the whole depth of the amphi-
theatre.

5. Pelignis. A secondrate wine apparently. The best
wines were of Latin and Campanian growth.

agitur apparently = premitur. This is not the vintage that
is pressed in Pelignian presses,

6. Tuscis according to xm. 118 ‘Tarraco Campano tantum
cessura Lyaeo Haec ,qenuit Tuscis aemula vina cadis‚’ the
Tuscan wine ranked as equal to the Spanish wines, and second
only to the Campanian—-what wines Martial means precisely
by Tuscan there and here is not clear, but they can hardly
have included Veientane and Vatican wines which were the
commonest of all. He does not speak of the worst wines here
but second rate. The wine supplied by Domitian in the
amphitheatre was not moderately good wine, he says in fact,
but superb. These four lines are of course elaborate flattery of
