of the equestrian and even of the senatorial order. Such as-
sumption and encroachments were facilitated (1) by the fact
that the nobility of wealth was fast superseding the nobility of
ancient birth, and though an honourable pedigree might add a
lustre to wealth‚ a poor representative of a noble family met
with little or no respect; (2) by the power of the Court freed-
men‚ who down to the time of Vitellius monopolised the offices
of the Imperial household, and down to the time of Hadrian
occupied the most important of them. These confidential ser-
vants, practically the most powerful people in Rome, would
naturally extend their protection to their wealthy confreres‚
being bound to them by a common opposition to the old no-
bility, whom it was the early emperors’ policy to depress and
weaken: (3) by the fact that a considerable portion of the
senatorial order, though never freedmen or slaves themselves,
were descendants of freedmen and slaves. Some of the Em·
perors (Nero and Domitian especially) had issued edicts forbid-
ding the assumption of equestrian privileges by those who were
not properly entitled to them, but these edicts appear practi-
cally to have had no force, or at any rate to have rapidly sunk
into abeyance‚ owing mainly to the fact that the Emperors
themselves were generally the first to violate them. Horace,
Epod. IV. describes a similar upstart in his time. The assump-

tion of Equestrian privileges was of course more common than
the assumption of Senatorial.

worth while to imitate it. The restrictiori of gold rings to
the senatorial and equestrian orders, though Nero tried to
revive it, was now completely disregarded, Friedla‘nder 1. c.
