172 NOTES. SPEOT. XXIII—XXIV.

XXIH. On Carpophorus, a youthful bestiarius who distin-
guished himself by his extraordinary skill and strength in the
arena. In Spect. xv. he is declared to be far superior to Meleager,
whose fame rated at its highest value was only portio Carpophori,
i.e. a fraction of Carpophorus’s fame (Carpophori=9l0riae
Carpophori, cf. Horace, Odes 11. vi. 14, Hymetto=Hymetti
melli), and quite equal to Hercules, since he had killed a lion of
unparalleled sizo, iynota mole leonem. In Speot. xxv11. he is
again preferred before the heroes Theseus, Bellerophon, Jason
and Perseus. On the Venationes see Friedlander 11. 366 sqq.

1. Norica. Cf. Horace, Odes 1. xvi. 9.

3. facili cervice is variously explained by the commenta-
tors- Some understand it to qualify juvencos, and suppose
an allusion to the quick movements of the head which
make those animals dangerous and difficult to strike. Others
understand it of the man’s neck, but explain it in two
different ways: (1) that the skill of Carpophorus in turning
his head so as to elude the attacks oi the brutes is intended;
(2) that the expression describes the ease with which Car·
pophorus sustained the attacks, facili cervice suggesting
simply the upright posture in which with skilful ease Car·
pophorus fought. This seems most in accordance with the
artificial style of the later Latin poets.

tulit=sustinuit.

5. in tela. Those of attendants, probably, whose duty it
would be to guard the entrances to the arena.

6. 1 nunc expresses defiance, cf. 11. 6. 1. ‘I nunc, edere me
jube libellos,’ and 1. 42. 6, where Porcia's determined suicide by
swallowing burning charcoal is described, and Martial adds in
his own person, as present in imagination at the scene,
‘I nunc, et serrum, turba molesta, naqa!

corripe, ‘now find fault with the tedious length of the per-
formanee, if you oan.’ The people seem to have objected
to any one performance being unduly prolonged. Martial
defies them to find fault with a performance so rapid and
varied as this. For the use of corripio, cf. Suet. August.
0. 53, ‘Indecoras adulationes..‚yravissime competit edicto)

XXIV. On a Naumachia, or naval battle exhibited for the

amusement of the people, apparently in the amphitheatro.
These exhibitions dated from the time of Julius Caesar, who
