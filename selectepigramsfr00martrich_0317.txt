2. tabula, sc. proscriptorum.

Cicerone=nece Ciceronis. ⁴ Whom this whole proscription
did not stain so deep with guilt as the single murder of Cicero.'

3. Romana, final a lengthened before str of strinyis. Cf.

de Spect. xxvnx. 10. For the sentiment cf. 111. 66, on the
same subject ‘Hoc tibi Roma caput, cuni loquereris, erat.’

4. hoc nefas. The murder of Cicero,
nec=ne quidem. Of. V. 62. 5.

5. miles. Popilius Laenas, whom Cicero had formerly de-

named were probably brothels and gaming-houses, hence the
rapidity with which the freedman's money disappeared.

4. quattuor. Perhaps those mentioned 11.'14. 11. The

neighbourhood of baths would be a very natural position for
popinae.

6. neczne Quidem, see last Epigr.

LXXIX. Zoilus to display his wardrobe changes his synthe-

6. enim=7cip. ‘ Why !'
LXXX. A petition to his friend Severus to read and criti-

cise his epigrams and, if it is not to much to ask, to get Secun-
