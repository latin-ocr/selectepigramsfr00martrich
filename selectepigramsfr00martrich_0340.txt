314 NOTES. VII. xii. 12—xvii. 9.

12. liber agrees with lector. Martial appeals here to
the unpreJudiced reader, because it was envy of his popularity
that had made people father these spurious epigrams upon him.

In lector he apparently turns from Faustinus and addresses
himself to the public generally.

XVII. Sent with a present of the first seven books.
1. ruris. The description of the house is given Π. 64.

delicati. ⁴ Dainty,' ‘ charming,’ or perhaps ‘ your owner’s
pet.’ Cf. 1v. 30. 16.

3. sanctiora. ‘Loftier,’ the poems of poets, who uttered
nothing low,

Sanctus used of persons means (1) a man whose office
renders his person inviolable; (2) one whose character renders
him invioIable, secures him from attack, a man possessed of the
dignity which comes of a pure and blameless life, commanding
respect for his sels-respect. In this sense it is used of things
also—⁶ dignified by being blameless.’

5. nido. The library, used by the Romans only to keep
books in, was fitted with cupboards or lockers. These stood
round the walls and wherever there was available space. The

appearance of these suggested the columbarium or pigeon house
with pigeon holes (nido). Cf. 1. 117. 15.

imo. On the floor.

7. notatos. i.e. marked with the author’s corrections in
his own handwriting. So Ep. 11 of this book, Coyis me
calamo manuque nostra Emendare meos Pudens libellos. O quam
me nimium probas aviasque, Qui vis archetypas habere naqa-3!
In regard to the necessity for correction, cf. 11. 8, where his
jocular ascription of any faults in his poems to the copyists‚
nocuit librarius illis Dum properat versus annumerare tibi,
shows that their copying often was faulty, as we should natu-
rally expect.

9. delicata. If this be the right reading it must mean
‘ vain or proud of,’ ‘ feeling, as it were, petted by receiving my
present,' but dedicata the old reading seems far preferable,
‘honoured by the dedication of my humble gift.' Cf. Ovid Fast.
VI. 637, Te quoque maym'fica, Concordia, dedicat aede, Livia.
The bibliotheca is personified‚ and if a god could be said to be
dedicated by a new temple, Martial by a little extension of the
use might speak of the library as dedicated by his gift. Fried-
l‘ander (Recensio locorum, διο.) reJ'ects both delicata and dedi-
cata, and thinks that they may be corruptions of some expres-
sion containing aucta.
