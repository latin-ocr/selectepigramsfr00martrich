phiala which Paullus had sent him, but it is only
to give all the more force and point to the last four
lines which accuse Paullus of trying to get credit as a
generous patron at little or no expense to himself.
x. 33 contains an elaborate description of a Formian
villa. But the elaborateness of the description, charm-
ing as it is in itself, from the epigrammatist's point of
view serves only to intensify the regret that the owner
never enjoyed the oharms of his villa, “Dominis
parantur ista, serviunt vobis (sc. villicis). ’'

Some of Martial's epigrams belong to the class of
epigrams proper or inscriptions and were evidently
written to be affixed to tombs, pictures, busts, &a
In these the characteristics of the literary epigram are
perhaps not so strongly marked, but even here, the
same type is observed. The epigram is not merely an
explanation of the monument, but contains, as it were,
an explanation of that explanation, a motive for
writing the epigram beyond the mere statement
required by the monument.

Martia] then, did not create the epigram. Many
others, as Lessing says, had written 'epigrams before
him, notably, Catullus, whom Martial with a modesty
which a man of less originality could not have afforded,
professedly regarded as his master and model. What
he did do, was to differentiate the epigram and
elaborate it. Adhering always to what he considered
the true type, and always preserving the essentiul
characteristics of this branch of poetry, he employed
his vast resources of satire, wit, observation, fancy, and
pathos to produce the greatest number of varieties that
the type admits of. On this ground it is that he may
fairly be called the first epigrammatist, though not the
first epigram-writer. A full discussion of all the
varieties of his epigrams as well as of the manners
and customs that gave occasion to them, would
lead us beyond the limits of a short introduc-tion.
