IN TROD UO TI OM x xiii

Those who wish for more information on the former
head are referred to Lessing's essay, fiber das epigram ς
on the latter the best information is derived from a

perusal of the epigrams themselves.
The metres used by Martial besides Tne metres used

the hexameter and elegiae, are: ΙΨ Mamm·

(α) The hendecasyllabic. The scheme of this
metre in Martia] is always the same, viz. :

-----------

(b) Τὶιθ choliambic or scazon, an iambic line
with a spondee in the last place.

υ- υ- υ- υ·-

Ι

 

 

 

 

 

Marti-al resolves the iambus into the tribrach, and
the spondee into the dactyl, and anapaest‚ within the
following limits. He admits a dactyl in (1) and (3), a
tribrach in (2), (3), and (4), and an anapaest in (l).
He prefers the penthemimeral caesura, which in resolved
feet falls after the first syllable. In one epigram (Ι.
61) scazons alternate with iambic dimeters.

- (c) The iambic proper, trimeter and dimeter.
This metre admits of the same resolution of the spondee
and iambus as the choliambic. In 1. 49. 22 Martial
has an anapaest in the third foot of a dimeter. In
three epigrams he has trimeters alternating with
dimeters, in two, trimeters only.

(d) Ionic a majore. Of this metre tho only
specimen is one epigram of two lines, 111. 29,
Has cfim gemi Ι na compede Ι dedIcat ca Ι tena s,

Martial does not use his metres at random. There
is a connexion between the sense and the metrical form
. of the epigrams, but here again a full discussion of the

subject would lead us beyond our limits.
