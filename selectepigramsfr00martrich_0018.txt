xvi MARTIAL.

magnify Domitian's mei-its and to overlook his faults.
Martial was a provincial and a litei-ary man. and it was
as overseers of the government of the provinces, and as
patrons of literature, that the emperors appeared in the

There is not so much to be said against him after all.
Personally I am naturally disposed to think well of
him. His brother was very kind to me 3 he is always
courteous and gentlemanly : when he refuses a request,
