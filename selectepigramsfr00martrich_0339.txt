NOTES. VII. vii1.9-xii. 11. 313

9, 10. ‘Even you may listen to such wanton jokes‚ since
the Triumph itself allows them.’ Triumphus seems to have
been generally more or less personified 111 the minds of Romans.
All that Martial 11103118, 18 to compliment Domitian for his
magnanimity in not interfering with the traditional licence 01
the soldiers at triumphs.

XII. Martial protests against the fathering of certain scur-
rilous personal epigrams upon him.

1. sic...1eg·at..,ut. The regular form of solemn assevera-
tion and adjuration. Gr. οὔτως...ὠς. Τ110 ὠς and ut are 110-
quently omitted. Of. Hor. Odes 1. iii. ‘By all my hopes of
being read, δία, Ι 811031, &cst

dominus. The Emperor.

3. nec=71e quidem, ne eos quidem quos odit.

Another reading is odi.

Comp. 101 the statement the preface of book 1.

What Martial means, apparently, both there and here, is
that when he has abused people for vices, ἄτα, 110 1138 abused
them under fictitious names, and 80 has attacked not the men
themselves but their vices, And this he has done even in the
case 01 1101801131 enemies. The position that he 01311118 111 this
respect would be exactly the converse 01 the position 01 the
author of the letters 01 Junius.

4. et. mihi. ‘And Ι 0310 not 101 fame won by putting
another man to shame.'

5. quid prodest. ‘ But what is the 1180 01 this when people
{glilqascribe to me any virulent personal epigrams that come

6. Lycambeo. Cf. Horace, Epod, VI. 13. Lycambes was
driven to commit suicide by the virulent personal attacks of
Archilochus, who was a reiected suitor 101 1118 daughter's hand.
‘Weapons reeking with Lycambes’ blood' are, therefore, epi-
grams such as killed Lycambes. So Ovid Ibis. 54 Tincta Ly-
cambeo sanquine tela dabglt.

7. vipereum. Cf. the Book 01 Psalms, 140. 3.

10. per genium. ‘By the Divinity of Fame.' Genius in
such expressions = δαίμων, 311 Influence personified: so Petronius
has per genium Priapi.

11. numinis. Because his position as a poet depended
on his gaining the favourable attention of the public.
