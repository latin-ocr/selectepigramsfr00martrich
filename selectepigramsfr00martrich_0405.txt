sine Gram. Without the necessity for a commentator to
expound them. Most of the 9rammatici published commen-
taries on various authors.

XXIV. Martial celebrates his fifty-seventh (or fifty-sixth ?)
birthday on the first of March, by offerings of cakes and incense
(1x. 90. 15-19, Horace, Odes, 111. viii.) to his genius.

3. et puellae. See reference quoted above. Men generally
sent presents to girls on this day. But Martial, thanks to
the lucky accident of his birthday‚ received presents from girls,
as well as (et) from his male friends.

4. quinquagesima..septimamque. A curicus and very
artificial condensation, for quiuquayesima septima liba et quin-
quagesimam septimam acerram ; that is, he offers cakes and
incense for the 57th time.

6. si tamen. ‘ That is, if,' expresses a readiness to with-
draw a statement, if obJectezl to, a use that has grown out of
the use of tamen with ellipse of the quanquam clause, (et
quamquam royo), si tamen empedit (royo). Cf. Ovid, Trist. 111.
xiv. 24, ‘Nunc incorrectum populi pervenit in ora, Iu populi
quidquam si tamen ore meum est?

9. areis, The three stages of life, early manhood, middle
age, and old age, expressed perhaps with reference to the
number of missus in a day's racing in the circus, which at
this time waS, as a mle, 24. This multiplied by three gives a
number near enough to the 75 of Martial's wish to suggest the

elilsslusion to the circus. Friedlander, 11. 326. Compare vn. 32.

10. Elysiae puellae. Proserpine.

11. post hoc. Friedlander’s emendation (comp. 1. 103.
5, 1v. 73. 8, vn. 64. 2), instead of post huuc.» ‘ After this 1
will not ask Nestor for a single day.’ That is, ‘not Nestor⁷s
long life would make me wish to live beyond that’...With
Schneidewin’s reading, huuc must agree with Nestora, the
concrete for the abstract.

nec = ue quidem.

XXVI. On another centurion friend of Martial, Varus, who
died in Egypt.

1. Paraetomas=Egyptian‚ from a town in the Cyrenaica
with a large harbour. Statius, Theb. v. 10, Paraetonius Nilus.
