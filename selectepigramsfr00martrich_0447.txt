laenam, a cloak. It was made, at least when intended
for out of door use, of thick warm material. XIV. 136, ‘ Laena .-
Tempore brumali non multum laevia prosunt.- Calfaciunt villi
pallia vestra mei) Comp. 126, ‘Hanc tibi pro Laena mit-
timus endromida,' dcc. It was worn over any other garment,
especially perhaps in returning from dinner. v111. 59. 10, of a
thief returning from dinner‚ ‘ et tectus laenis saepe duobus abit!
Comp. JuV. 111. 283. Perhaps also at dinner, Persius 1. 32.

3. aureolos. V. 19. 14.

4. ducere. ‘To prolong two kalends’ is an artificial ex-
pression meaning ‘to last or hold out for two months.’ Kalendas
might be taken as accusative of duration, and ducere absolute

Wtsti] ellipse of tempus or se, but the former is more in Martial’s
s y e.

8. Pisones Senecasque. Cf. 1v. 40. “When Martial came
to Rome about the year 63, the halls of the Pisos, filled with
portraits of ancestom, and the three houses of his countrymen
the Senecas (the philosopher, Junius Gallio, and Annaeus Mela,
father of Lucan), stood open to 111111. All these perished in
ΑΛ), 65 and 66, and towards the end of the first century the only
survivor of the great house of the Senecas was Polla Argentaria,
the wife of Lucan, whom Martial addresses by the title of
Queen (2¹1.⁴ 64, vn„ 21—23). In the time of Domitian no more
such friends of literature were seen as the Pisos and the Senecas

as Vibius Crispus (1v. 54. 7) and Memmius Regulus (consul in
A.D.· 63).’' Friedl. 111. 339„

XXXIX. A happy little jeu—d'esprit playing on 1116 word
belias. On the bellas homo see 111. 63.

XLVIII. An answer to an invitation to dinner. If it is
bonafide, Martial will accept. If it is given with a view to a
legacy, he wifl refuse. The grandest banquet in the world
would be dear at the price. And after all, what is a dinner?—-
a mere passing enjoyment, gone when the table is cleared—all
that remains of it is indigestion and. gout.
