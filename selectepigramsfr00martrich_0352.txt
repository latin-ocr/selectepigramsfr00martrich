sapae=defruti‚ w. 46. 9. Martial means perhaps Laletan
wine doctored with sapa. See Becker, Gallus, p. 486.

7. canis probably has no reference to colom, but is used
in the sense of ‘aged’ (1. 15. 2), with an allusion to the
shrivelled state of the preserved pluma„ probably Damascenes.

LIV. An appeal to Nasidienus to eease dreaming inaus—
picious dreams about the poet before the expense of perpetual
expiations ruined him. The belief in dreams was as wide-
spread as ever, among all classes, affecting even men of high

cariosa Falerni, Expiet ut somnos yarrula saya tuos. ι

exorare temptant, a common meaning with aecus. of person.
There seems to be no parallel to the use of accus. of thing in
this sense, but it is intelligible enough. ‘To appease‚ or
satisfy with prayerS‚ the visione of the night (noctes)’ is, to
avert by religious ceremonies the evils that they portended.
