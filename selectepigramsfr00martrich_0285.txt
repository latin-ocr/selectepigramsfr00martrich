mettiis) respectively. It formed part of the qustus.

9. quondam. ‘When the time comes' For this use of
quondam relating to future events, in which case it means not
simply olim ‘ at some future time‚' but rather ‘at a certain,’ or
‘ in due time,’ comp. Verg. Aen. VI. 87, nec Romula quondam
Ullo se tantum tellus Jactabit alumno, and Horace Sat. 11. ii. 82,

diction: perhaps a kind of Equity Com-t: Pliny the younger
practised in it)...Postquam bis senis inyemem fascibus an-
num Rexerat, asserto (liberated. i.e. the year of Nero's death,
1. 52. 5) qui sacer orbe fuit, Emeritos Musis et Phoebo tradidit

Silius haec mayni celebrat monimenta Maronis, Juqera facundi
qui Ciceronis habet. Of. also Χῖ. 49, 111 v, 4 of which aetatem
(Barth's conjecture) should be read instead of et vatem, i.e.
Silius has earned immortality no less than Vergil; aetatem or
vetustatem ferre meaning to have a permanent, lasting value,
by a metaphor derived from wine. Prof. Conington, Jour.
Phil. Vol. 11.

3. premis...cog·ls. The poet is represented as doing what
