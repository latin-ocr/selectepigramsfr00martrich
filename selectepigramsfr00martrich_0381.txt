NOTES. IX. xviii. 4—xx. 6. 355

XVHI. Contains a double petition to be allowed to have
water laid on to his house in the city, as well as to his subm-ban
farm. When Martial became possessed of this house in the
city seems uncertain. In the earlier part of his life in Rome
he lived in cenacula, up three pairs of stairs, 1. 117. The rus
is probably the Nomentane one so often mentioned: whence
the water was to be supplied to it‚‚he does not say, for v. 6
apparently only applies to the town house.

4. 3111113. The pole and bucket. See Smith, Dict. Ant.
sm. Curva (the reading of Schneidewin's first edition which is
far preferable to curta) refers to the bending of the pole in

lifting the bucket.

6. fonte. One of the 105 spouting fountains supplied
from the aqua Marcia. On the aqueduots see Ramsay, Roman
Antiq. p, 54 sqq. On the aqua Marcia, see vr. 42. 18. Some
of the arches of this aqueduct between Tibur and Rome still

exist, Eum, p. 71.

8. Castalis, The water that you bestow on me, shall be
as water from the gods—from the fountain of Castalia, or from
heaven itself. In Castalis there may be 3 compliment intended

XX. On the conversion of the house, in which Domitian

1. quae...patet. ‘ Open to all comers in all its length
and breadth.' Patet expresses the publicity of the temple, as
opposed to the privacy of the house. Martial indirectly praises
Domitian for his benevolence in throwing open to all the
ground in which all the world is interested.

2. domim. For the genitive, compare VI. 10. 9.

existed was raised.’

6. Rhodos, Poseidon is said to have been entrusted to
the Rhodian Telchines by Rhea. But this allusion is not quite
in keeping with astrifero coelo. And the introduction of another
god rather spoils the parallelism between the Lord of the earth,
and the Lord of the sky. It is more probable that Martial
