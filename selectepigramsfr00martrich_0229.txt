NOTES. I. xcix. 15—cviii. 6. 203

15. plumbea, lesden, i.e. counterfeit.
selibra, properly a half pound. Here used for half an as.

17. optamus. If your avarice progressed in the same pro-
portion to the increase of your wealth as it has done so far,

vzith 130‚OO0,000 sesterces (2800,000) you would simply die of
s arva 1011.

CVHI. To Gallus (? Munatius Gallus, x. 33) excusing him-
self for not attending his morning levee as a salutator. Two
other epigrams‚ x. 56 and 82, are addressed to Gallus on the
same subject.

2. Transtiberina. Cf. 1. 41. 3.

3. Vipsanas. ‘ If, as seems probable, this is identical with
the Porticus Polae and the Porticus Europae and the Porticus
Agrippae, it stood probably in that portion of the seventh or
Via Lata region known as the Campus Agrippae. From
Martial 1v. 18, we conclude that this portico stood near an arch

gn thggia Lata, over which an aqueduct passed.’ Burn, R. and
. p. .

cenacula, in the plural a lodging at the top of an insula or
lodging-house. Martial was on the third floor. Of. 1. 117. 8.
This would be a house of average height. Not many houses
appear to have had four floors above the ground fl00r‚ and very
sever, if any, more than four.

laurus indicates a grove of laurels or bay trees in connexion
with the portico.

4. reg-ione the 7th, or Via Lata. For the position of
Martial’s house cf. 1. 2. 8.

5. mig-randum est. ‘To wait upon you every morning I
must make a regular peregrination.’ Mifflamzum can hardly
mean, as Messrs. Paley and Stone take it, ‘I must change my
abode3’ for in that case the next lines would be pointless. If
Martial had meant that retaining Gallus’s friendship was worth
the trouble (v. 6) of changing his abode‚ the natural reply would
have been ‘Why in the world don't you change it, then?' But
what Martial evidently means is, that, though Gallus deserved
any thing that Martial could do for him, the gain to Gallus of
Martial’s attendance at the morning levee would be nothing,
while the loss of time to Martial caused by this daily migration
would be very' serious.

6. tanti. cf. 1. 12. 11.
illa, sc. domus3 longius, ‘farther off still.2
