388 NOTES. X. xlviii. 23—1. 1.

bis for iterum is curious. Facciolati gives no parallel.

23. prasino...veneto. The green and blue factions in
the circus. On these factions and colours see Friedlander,
11. 307 sqq. Mayor on Juvenal, XI. 198.

24. faciunt. There seems no necessity to alter this to
facient or faciant. Martia] says his guests were made to talk
of such topics as the circus factions, and therefore, as a fact,

farm, where the word is opposed to cerea.

Plumbeus is used (apart perhaps from this metaphor) of
