NOTES. III. vi. l—vii. 2. 237

VI. To Marcellinus, a youth who was celebrating the first
shaving of his beard on his father's birthday. The day on
which the beard was shaved for the first time, a sign that a boy
had reached man’s estate, was observed as a festival.

1. tertia, i. e. May 17th.

3. imputat, διο. ‘ To this day your father is indebted for
his first entrance into the light of day.’ aetherios=caelestes.

Imputat the opposite to acceptum refert, ‘to acknowledge
an obligation‚’ a post-Augustan word. ἔην. v. 15.

prima...imputat is a condensed expression for prima vitae
dies erat et imputat. The expression is a little strained, pro-
bably for the sake of the repetition of the prima.

6. plus. Sc. quam id quod hodie filius vir evasit.

VH. On the cessation of the money sportula. The whole
subject is involved in great obscurity. All that appears to be
certain is that the sportula was a dole, either in kind or money,
given by patrons to their clients in consideration of the ser-
vices which they rendered: that from the middle of the first
century ΑΛ). (most probably from the time of Nero), the dole in
kind was commuted for a fixed sum of money, 100 quadrantes:
and that for a short time in the reign of Domitian the custom
was introduced or revived, apparently, of entertaining the
olients at dinner (coena recta) instead of giving the 10 sesterces,
That this only lasted for a short time is inferred from the fact
that it is only mentioned in this book.

These sportulae given by the patrons must be'oarefuuy dis-
tinguished from the sportulae publicae, doles of meat or money
given by the emperors to the people‚ and sometimes by rich
and influentia] citizens, instead of entertaining them at public
banquets. The dinners also given instead of the centum
quadrantes must not be eonfounded with the occasional invi-
tation to dinner given by patrons to clients at all times.

The patrons appear to have followed the lead of the
emperors in the matter. Nero substituted the doles for the
public banquet, and Domitian revived the banquets, Suet.
Nero. 16, Domit. 7. The reason why the oustom of the coena
recta instead of the money was so soon abandoned, was that
most of the clients, who were probably clients to more than
one patron, depended for subsistence on the sportula. Their
patron’s dinner would not pay their rent, buy them clothes, διο.

2. anteambulonis. Cf.» 11. 57. 5.
