NOTES. ΙΙ. xix. 2—-xxix, 215

2. deinde. ‘And a dinner at your house, too.’ Lit. ‘in
the second place at your house.’ Primum is implied before cena.
The effect of this 1189 01 deinde, like the somewhat similar 1189
01 denique, is to throw great stress on what follows.

3. Aricino olivo, the steep hill below Aricia, a town on the
Appian Road, where beggars congregated and besieged the
carriages of travellerS. JUV. IV. 118 Diynus Aricinos qui
mendicaret ad acces Blandaque devexae jactaret basia rhedae.
The sense here is ‘a man must be very hard up for a dinner,
11 a dinner of yours could make him happy.’

XXIV. On the false professions of friendship made by
Candidus, a man who was always quoting the Greek proverb
κοινὰ φίλων and saying what he would do for Martial in cases
which were never likely to 000111, but practically was not
ready to do anything for him. In the first four lines Martial
is evidently quoting Candidus’s words or professions of friend-
ship. ‘ I will stand by you at the bar of Justioe, Ι will follow
you into exile if need be.' Wess, says Martial: Fortune has
made you rich3 will you share your wealth with me? “Oh 1 ’'
says Candidus, “my money cannot belong to both of us.”
‘ ‘ Then will you give me some of it?'’ ‘⁴ That is too much to
ask.’' “Will you give me anything? No of course you will
not: you will share adversity with me, but you will keep your
prosperity all to yourself.’' Cf. 11. 43.

1. reatum. The condition 01 a reus or person accused of a

0111111119. t. The word is a late one and disallowed by Augustus as
no a 111.

2. squalidus properly means sully, so shaggy and un-
shorn, but here it seems to be used generally=squalidis capil-
lis promissaque barba sordidatus, the two signs of mourning.
Men who wished to appeal to the pity of their fellow citizens,
either on their own behalf, or on behalf of a friend, went about
with the hair untrimmed‚ the beard unshaven‚ and dressed in
old and worn out garments. See Livy 111. 47.

5. dat, 80. Fortuna.
ecquid. Interrogative particle3 here=num.
6. das ‘ are you for giving? ' almost=a future.

XXIX. On another parvenu of the Zoilus type (cf. Epig.
16) 0119 01 that class, peouliar to the empne, and dating appa·
rently from the Civil war, of enfranehised slaves who had by
some means or other amassed large fortuneS, and on the
strength of their weahh, assumed the insignia and privileges
