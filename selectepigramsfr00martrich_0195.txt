all the intervening ground. Suet. Nero c. 31, ‘Domum (ι
Palatio Esquilias usque fecit quam...auream nominavit!
Suetonius also quotes an epigram made about it:

Roma domus fiet: Veios mimate, Quirites,
Si ‘non et Veios occupat ista domus.
Mel-ivale vi. 355. Burn R. and C. 231—3.

6. stagna. This was the great pleasure lake of the Golden
Palace. Suetonius (Nero c. 31> says of it that it was ‘maris
instar, circumseptum aedificiis ad urbium speciem.' No doubt the
applianceS‚ pipes, δια, by which the lake was supplied with
water were retained, and utilised for the purpose of exhibit'mg
naval battles and other aquatic entertainments in the amphi-
theatre. See Spect. xxvr„ xxvm.

7. thermas. That part of the aurea domus which stood
on the Oppian hill, or a considerable portion of it, was con-
verted by Titus into public baths.

velocia.. Cf. Suet. Tit. c. 7. ‘Thermis celeriter exstructis)

9. porticus. Mr Burn (R. and C. p. 233) says, ‘These
Thermae were connected with the Coliseum by a portico, traces
of which are to be seen on the north side of the amphitheatra)
This may be the portico here alluded to, though it would hardly
answer to the description ‘ultima pars aulae '. Mr Merivale
apparently supposes that it was connected with the Claudian
temple on the Coelian3 in which case Martial is here giving
the limits of the palace in two directions, Merivale VI. c. 35 n.
Vespasian certainly rebuilt the temple of Claudius, Suet.
Vesp. c. 9. Others understand it to mean the porticus Liviae
on the Esquiline.

10. deficientis. For this use of deficio, cf. Pliny N. H.

¹¹··1⁰’‚ ‘talis fiyura semper mucrone deficit‚’ i.e. ‘ends in a
pomt.

IV. On the repression of the delatores, The epigram
was, no doubt, originally written in honour of Titus. But it
would be to a certain extent applicable to Domitian also, who
in the first years of his reign discouraged and punished de-
lation. Suet. Dom. c. 9. On the chronology of this book see
Appendix 1.

On the class of delatores, see Church and Brodribb ‘Annals

‘gisl 'Tacitus’ p. 394, note on the ‘lex maffestatis and the
e a ores.
