15. Rubras. Apparently the same as Saxa Rubra (Livy 11.
49 and Cicero, Philipp. 11. ἓ 77), a village on the via Flaminia,
between Rome and Narnia, about m’ne miles from the former,
now Porta Prima. The name was derived from the red tufa
rocks which bordered the via Flaminia on the left for a con·
siderable distance. Eum, p. 419.

16. virgineo cruore seems quite inexplicable. Rubore is an
emendation suggested and supported by the description given of
the festival by Ovid, Fasti 111. 525 sqq. It was celebrated on
the ides of March in a grove on the Via Flaminia, and was ap·
parently an occasion for unmitigated debauchery.

18. flaminiae. The great northern road issued from the
Porta Carmentalis, and formed the main line of communication
between the city and Gallia Cisalpina. ‚

23. cum, although.

Milvius. Martial means probably that the Milvian bridge
appeared to be quite close to a man looking down from the
villa. That it was not actually very close is shown by the
sounds from the Tiber not being heard.

25. rus, country house. Domus, town house ; because it
might be said to be in Rome.
