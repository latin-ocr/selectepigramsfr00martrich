2. manus. ‘ bandy-work! So also used of handwriting.

3, 4. If the material of the cup was metal, this must
mean that it would not tarnish, or oxidise, and that it was
of metal which if tested in the crucible would prove to be
pure. But there is a good deal in Lessing’s remark, “who
in the world would throw a golden vessel into the crucible to
test it ?''

On the supposition that the bowl was of metal, nubila must
be part of the predicate qualified equally with odit by the non
in nec, describing in fact what the bowl was not; ‘is not the
lustreless stuff that hateS,’ &a

5. electra. This term is used of three distinct substances,
(1) amber, which it probably means here3 (2) a natural com-
bination of ξ gold and {- silver, formed in the mine itself; (3)
a similar combination of metals formed artificially. If the cup
was metal, the meaning probably is that the metal of it shone
with a yellow lustre like amber itself. Some suppose the
opposition implied to be between the artificial and the natural

metal-electrum.

metallo. For the use of metallum to express substances
other tha-n metals, see Facciolati s.v.

6. pustula. Whether right or wrong about the material of
the cup, there can be little doubt that Lessing is right in
assuming pustula to be not per synecdochen for amentum pas-
tulatum—‘frosted silver work,' according to Messrs Paley and
Stone—but a natural fiaw or white spot in the material, which
the artist utilised to represent the moon shining on the scene,
of which the boy on the goat was the prominent object. This
explains felix, lucky—happy or fortunately placed—an epithet
which other commentators have slurred. Vv. 7 and 8 are then
descriptive of this moon which the artist, making use of the
lucky flaw or spot, has so vividly represented. It would cer-
tainly be ‘ damning’ an artist ‘ with faint praise' to commend
his patera for being so remarkably round.

7. alligare orbem is a curious expression for the moon show-
ing her full orb, but perhaps is meant to express the clear sharp
(tense, as it were,) outline of the full moon in a clear sky:
