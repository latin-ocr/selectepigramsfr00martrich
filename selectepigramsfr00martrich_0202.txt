176 NOTES. SPECT. XXVIII. 9—XXIX. 6.

9. Circo. Cf. 1. 5. ferventes currus.
amphitheatro 1. 4, iynotas feras.

10. dives, ‘ rich in wonders:

caesarea.. If this is the right reading, the final ‘a’ oi
Caesarea is lengthened before the pr. of praestitit. Cf. 11. 66. 8.
But it is a question whether Caesareo is not the right reading.
‘To thee, the subject of our Caesar! Dives Caesarea unda, is
clumsy writing for Martial..

11. Fucinus. Of. Spect. xxiv,

pigri ‘ unenterprising’ by comparison. Cf. our slang use of
the word ‘ slow.'

Neronis. Suet. Nero. c. 12. Eaehibuit et naumachiam
marina aqua innantibus beluis,’ i.e. fish and sea monsters.
Dio Cass. 61. 9, 5. Nero’s animals were notae to the marine
deities. Domitian’s (or Titus’s), iynotae.

XXIX. On a prolonged contest between two gladiators
which ended in both being ‘rude donati,’ presented with their
discharge, and rewarded as victors. The Emperor is praised
for his rigid adherence to the law of the arena.

3. missio was the term used when a gladiator, wounded and
making his submission, was allowed to retire from the contest
with his life. When the decision lay with the people‚ as
it usually did, the desire to spare the gladiator’s liie was
expressed by turning the thumb downwards (sometimes perhaps
by raising the thumb, see Friedl'ander, 11. 363), and waving
handkerohiefs. Cf. ΧΠ. 29. 8, cum ‘nuper Myrino peteretur
missio laeso, subduxit mappas quatuor H ermoyenea and Facciolati
s. V. pollex.

5. ad digitum=acz diyitum parma* posita levatum, i.e. till
the shield was lowered‚ and the finger raised. When a gladiator
was badly wounded (hoc habet), and unable to continue the fight,
he signified his submission by lowering his arms (submittere
arma), and holding up his finger.

6. lances donaque. Dishes filled with money, presented
to the gladiatore. On this use of the lanx, as a vehicle for a gift
oi money (corresponding somewhat to the modern testimonial
teapot)‚ compare JuV. vr. 204, “cum lance beata Dacicus
et scripto radiat Germanicus auro,’' i. e. coins of Domitian's reign.
