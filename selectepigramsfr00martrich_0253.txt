anque.

LXIV. On a man who could not make up his m'md
whether he would be a causidicus or a rhetor.

1. causidicum. The term causidicus meant a man who
pleaded any cause offered to him, for direct remuneration.
That they existed under the republic is proved by the lex
Uincia (B.c. 204) forbidding any one to receive money for
pleading a cause: a document which also proves that such men
had no legal status. That they were despised by what we may
call the Republican ‘bar,’ is proved by Cicero's allusions to
them. But under the empire the motives which actuated the
patroni (that is, the independent pleaders who undertook cases
criminal and civil, for the sake of the power and influence
which they thereby acquimd, and preserved their sense of dig-
nity by receiving only indirect remuneration in the shape‘of
legacies, Sec.) ceased to operate, and the ordinary pleading
business (all important state trials were conducted in the
Senate from which the public were excluded) practically passed
into the hands of the causidici, now a profession with a legal
position recognized by a law of Claudius fixing the maximum
fee at 100000 sesterces. These were assisted by praymatici
attorneys who instructed them in the law of the case as the
patroni had been assisted by J urisconsulti.

rhetora.. The teacher of oratory. These also existed in
Rome in republican times, Cic. Philipp. 11. 17, but were
generally held in little estimation. The best orators went to
Greece and Rhodes to study rhetoric, but as eloquence ceased
to be a practical power and began to be an accomplishment
‘that no gentleman ought to be without‚’ the schools of the
rhetores at Rome flourished. They taught their pupils the
theory of rhetoric very elaborately, and practised them in
speaking by means of rhetorical exercises‚ declamationes.
These under the empire took the place pretty much of the
practical oratory of the republic. Teuffel, ς 37.

t 13. transit perfect. An exaggeration much in Martial's
s y e.

4. fuerat. The pluperf. indic. expresses something which
ought to have taken place ancl did not. Cic. in Verr. 5. 31,
etsi recte sine exceptione dia-eram virum, cum isti essent, nemi-
nem fuisse, ‘1 should have said,’ correcting the' statement just
made. So it is used after a negative protasis, ‘nze truncus
