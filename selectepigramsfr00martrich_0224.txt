198 NOTES. I. lxix.—lxx. 7.

Martial says that the Tarentines have substituted statues of
the laughing Canius for those of the laughing Pan.

Tarentos. Most commentators understand this of the
Stayna Tarenti at the N. extremity of the Campus Martius,
where the ludi saeculares were held and where stood altars of
Dis and Proserpina. But there appears to have been no sort
of connexion between this place, and the worship of Pan.
That statues of Pan should have been frequent in merry
Tarentum is more than likely. Quae is the reading of several
MSS. and both forms Tarentum and Tarentos (fem). of the Greek
city were used. Of Silius XII. 433 Superba Tarentos.

LXX. An address to a presentation copy of his book sent
to Caius Julius Proculus a friend of the poet's, XI. 36. The
book was to do the poet's duty as salutator.

officiose. Officium in its limited society sense meant the
attentions due from the client to his patron an important
portion of which was the salutatio.

3. iter. The way was from Martial’s house on the
Quirinal 1. 2. 8 across the Fora of the Emperors and the
Forum Romanum to the sacer clivus, and so to the Palatine,
where Proculus's house stood.

castora. This temple stood on the S.W. ⁴side of the Forum
between the Basilica Sempronia and the Temple of Vesta.
Three columns oi it still remain.

canae. ‘Time-honoured.’ Cf. 1. 15. 2.

4. Vestae. Cf. Horace Sat. 1. 1x.‚ 35.

5. sacro clivo. The portion of the via saera between the
summa via sacra by the arch of Titus and the Forum Roma-
num. The ground slopes down from the summa saera via to
the Forum and it was here that triumphal processions first

gigne in siglgt5 of the Forum, and descended into it. Cf. Horace
χ es 1v. 11. .

6. plurima imago must mean ‘many a statue' and
the allusion must be to statues of Domitian whether in the
sacred way, or on the Palatine or both, it is impossible to say.
An equestrian statue of Domitian stood at the N.W. end of
the Forum Romanum, but that can hardly be meant here. It

is of course more than likely that there should be several
statues of the emperor about in the city.

7. colossi. Cf. spect. 11. 1.
