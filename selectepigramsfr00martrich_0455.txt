audaces. Explained by v. 8.

4. usus, ‘advantage’

5. toreumata. Ν. 46. 6.

7. quid, quod. ‘Then again!

9. propinabis. Martial means after some men’s lips have
touched a cup, you would not care to use it again; my cups‚
then, that you would not hesitate to break, may be useful when
you have to pledge such a man. On the custom cf. Verg. Aen.
1. 737, ‘Primaque libato summo tenus attviqit ore Tum Bitiae
dedit increpitans!

Martial uses the Greek form of the word in the sense of par-
taking of the ρας-τηε of a dinner. v. 78. 3, si soles προπίνειν.

LXXXII. On a dinner hunter, Menogenes. Cf. 11. 11.

’ therme...ba1nea. 11. 14. 11-13, 111. 20. 15.

3. captabit, &a It is almost impossible to explain this
satisfactorily. It is difficult to see how the parasite could lay a
man under an obligation by catching the balls himself, unless
the players played in sides. More probably some variety of the
trigon is-meant, in which the players were at liberty to throw
the bau to any one they pleased (not quite the same as φαίνινδα,
but something like it, IV. 19. 6). Menogenes, then, would
catch the ball right and left of him whenever he possibly could
in order to send easy catches to the man he was courting. In
that case imputare and acceptas will be taken together, ‘ to
reckon against you as received by you,’ acceptas not only mean·
ing literally caught by you, but suggesting the phrase acceptum
referre, the opposite of which might perhaps be expressed by
acceptum imputare.

5. follem. 1v. 19. 7. follem colliqere is rather curious for
‘ picking up a ball 3' perhaps the word is used in reference to the
size and looseness of the follis. Pliny uses it however of a rol]
of a manuscript. Ep. 11. 1, ‘Liber se1ni...elapsus est. Hunc dum
consequitur colliyitque‚' διο.

6. lotus. People played at ball usually before the bath.
