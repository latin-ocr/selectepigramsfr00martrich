directly a man reached the top of the path from the suburra.
The group apparently stood on the top of a theatre. What
theatre is meant, it is impossible to say with certainty, but the

7. udi...1ubricum. Generally explained of the effect of the
saffron water sprinkled during the performances, cf. v, 27. 7 ;

appearance of the roof and group in wet weather.

15. centum. Cf. 1v. 14.
17. Arpinis. The writings of Cicero.

This epigram is quoted by Pliny, 1. c. from v. 12. As it

they were written shortly before Martial's departure from
Rome.
