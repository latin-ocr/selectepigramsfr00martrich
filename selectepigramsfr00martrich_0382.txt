meant Jupiter in both parts of v. 6. But what tradition he
found connecting the infancy of Jupiter with Rhodes, it is
impossible to say. Perhaps he confused the Telchines, who
in the traditions were connected with both Crete, and Rhodes,

with the Curetes.

8. quana. The best that effeminate Phrygian priests could
carry. Qualia seems to signify rather the use made of the
arms, than the kind of arms used.

9. at te. Jupiter was protected by the Corybantes with
shields and spears (see Ovid, quoted above), You were pro-
tected by Jove himself with thunderbolt and aegis. There seems
no necessity to understand an allusion to Domitian's escape
from the Vitellians. Martial is speaking of the house where
the emperor was born, and lived as a child.

XXIII. Carus has been honoured by receiving the olive
crown at the Alban contest (1v. 1. 5). To Martial, enquiring
what he has done with the crown‚ he replies that it desired to
be allowed (ultro) to encircle the brows of a marble bust of Do·
mitian. To this, Martial rejoins that the pious oak (the oak-

because it (the olive wreath) had crowned the invincible head

(of Domitian) first.

by apologising for sending him his own poemS. To send verses
to such a poet, he says, is to send inferior perfumes to Cosmm,

violets to a man of Paestum, Corsican honey to Hyblaean bees
—anglice, to send inferior coals to Newcastle. Still the humbler

effusions may have some small charm of their own, as the
cheap olive forms a pleasing accompaniment to the expensive

ΡΞ glaucina. Probably an oil extracted from the plant
ylaucium, mentioned by Pliny, N. H. 2⁴7, ἓ 23. The stress

may lie on the pallida, the oil being useless if of a pale colour,
but all that can be said with certainty is that some inferior

kind of a material used by perfumers is meant.
