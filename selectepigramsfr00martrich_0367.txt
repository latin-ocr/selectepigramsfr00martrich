linen‚ that will not be hurried, shine bright and clear.' In
xrv. 103, ‘colum nivarium,’ Martial recommends the linum,
or saccus, for poorer wine only. So the epicure in Horace
Sat. 11. iv. 54, Inteyrum perdunt lino vitiata saporem, but
possibly in the case of such very old wine as this, the sediment
would be so considerable that linen would be required. The
strainer might let some of it through.

4. consule. Allusion to the custom of affixing to the
amphora a label with the name of the consul, in whose year
it was made. Of. Horace, Odes, 111. viii. 12.

facta minor, by deposit and evaporation.

XLVIH. Crispinus, changing his dress, handed his abolla
to some one standing by, who appropriated it. Crispinus
forgot who it waS‚ but Martial says that the abolla, being as
it is so remarkable in texture and colour, will expose the
thief, whom he recommends another time to steal a toga,

because all togas being of the same colour, he could more easily⁷
escape detection. On Crispinus see v11. 99.

1. Tyriam. The finest purple. Cf. 11. 16. 3.

abellam. A cloak or mantle worn over the toga (J uv. tv.
94), originally perhaps a military garment, a variety of the
sayum, but at this time worn by all classes (esp. philosophers)‚
and even apparently as a dinner dress, Marquardt v, ii. 172
sqq. Here possibly it is Crispinus’s uniiorm as praefectus
praetorio, which he is changing for his civilian’s dress (toyam).
Friedl. 1. 206, Mayor, Juv. Index, s.v. Crispinus.

5. quimmque=quivis, cf. 1. 41. 18.

6. deliciis=homini delicato. A luxurious, elegant, man
of fashion‚ with something perhaps of the notion expressed
by our ‘ favorite of fortune‚' cf. ΧΠ. 57. 19. It is rather curious
that Juvenal (1v. 4) and Martial speaking of the same man
from such different points of view, both apply this term to
him: perhaps it was a nickname that he affected. Martial
certainly cannot mean to use it in a disparaging sense.

L. On a public banquet, given by Domitian either in con-
nexion with the Dacian triumph, or more probably as part
of the public rejoicings after the conclusion of the Sarmatian

campaign, v. 5. From v. 2, it would appear to have been
accompam‘ed with illuminations.

1. Gigantei triumphi. Cf. Horace, OdeS‚ 111. i. 7. Mar-

tial'srtauthority for the festivity here alluded to seems quite
unce am.
