poets' Club³⁹, or in one of the many porticoes, in
bathing‚ dining, drinking and sleeping. Whenever he
could find time, he wrote epigrams, but he complains
that his many occupations‚ especially the taedia coyata,
the wearisome routine of attendance on his patrous,

He himself gives us (x. 70) a description of a single

his every-day life. It is pretty evident, however, that,
as his fame increased he neglected the duties of the
