226 NOTES. II. lvii. 6—lix. 3.

6. sella. A sedan chair. The lectica being a couch. The
sella was generally covered as here3 linteis being the curtains,
loris the straps by which it was carried. The lectica and the
sella ‚qestoria were the only conveyances legal inside the city,

cargissges drawn by animals being forbidden. Becker, Gallus
p. .

8. nummis, i.e. sestertiis. nummus, as a rule, means a
sesterce unless some epithet is prefixed to show that it is
used in a different sense.

LVHI. On Zoilus again, see 11. 16.

1. pexatus. Dressed in a toya pcata. Cf. 11. 44. 1 emi seu
puerum toyamve pexam.

pexa means new and glossy. Horace Epist. 1. 1. 95 si

forte subucula pexae trita subest tunicae. The opposite to
pexa is trita, not rasa.

2. sed mea sunt can hardly mean that Zoilus's grand
things were hired, for he was evidently a wealthy man, but
rather that they were procured with ill-gotten wealth.

LIX. An epigram on a banqueting hall coenatio (J uv. vn.
183), explained by the commentators to their own satisfaction
but to no one else’s. They tell us in the first place that it was
built by Domitian, a statement for which there appears to be
110 satisfactory evidence. Then most of them understand
Pholum Caesareum to mean the Mausoleum of Augustus, but,
letting alone the fact that tholus does not describe the Mauso-
leum, the Notitia reqionum (Eum, R. and O„ p. 223) places the
mica (mica aurea appears to have been the fun name) on the
Coelian. It is hardly credible that any building on the Coelian
should command a view of the Mausoleum about 1ss mile off
in the Campus Martius. Scaliger followed by Scriverius
understands tholus of the roof or ceiling of the mica itself, and
supposes a skull to have been suspended from it, but ea: me
and prospt'cis seem incompatible with such an interpretation.
Mr Burn understands tholum Caesareum of the palace of the
Caesare on the Palatine, which is very likely true, but it
throws no light on v, 4. It is most likely that the tholus was
some building now entirely unknown, the nature of which, if
we knew it, would explain the allusion in v, 4.

3. frange toros. Cf. 1v. 8. 6, Imperat exstructos franyere
nona toros. Frangere torum is to break the smooth surface of
the torus (11. 16. 3) by reclining 011 it.
