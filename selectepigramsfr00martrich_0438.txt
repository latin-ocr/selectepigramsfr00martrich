412 NOTES. XII. i. l—iii. 10.

1. Molossi. Hunting dogs‚ Verg. Georg. 111. 405.

4. aestiva. Less than an hour, and that a winter hour,
will be sufficient. Cf. 1v. 8. 7.

ΠΙ. Addresses his book, recommending it especially to the
care of Stella, now consul. 1. 61. 4.

1. ad populos. Abroad to the provinces, and outlying
peoples of the empire. cf. XI. 24. 6.

3. Salonis. x. 104. 6.

tetrici. Perhaps in allusion to the effect on iron, of har-
dening it. cf. riyidi applied to the same river, 1111. 21.

4. potens seems so weak and meaningless that some
authorities have thought the line to be corrupt. Heinsius
suggested, ‘ dat patrios jam nunc quae mihi terra Zares.’ Fried-
lander thinks the line corrupt, but thinks that manes is
probably right. He says, ‘qualem sensum desiderari putem
versu eaeempli yratia ficto siym'ficabo .· Nam patrios manes haec
mihi terra te9it.'

6. fratres. ‘ Previous books.’
domus Remi, apparently means simply urbs Romana.

7. iure tuo, as the work of a poet well known to the
Roman world. ·

templi. Generally understood to mean the temple of
Apollo Palatinus, built by Augustus, attached to which was
the famous Bibliotheca Graeca et Latina, Juv. vu. 37, Mr
Mayor’s note. The commentators explain novi by a supposed
restoration of the temple by Nerva, for which however they
gissm no authority. May not Martial allude to the Ulpian
li rary?

8. templa. Tecta, the emenda-tion of Heinsius, should
be read instead of templa.

9. Subura. ‘At the back of the Argiletum and between
the converging points of the Quirinal and Esquiline hills lay
the Suburra‚ a district of 111 fame, and much abused by poets
and historians of imperial times....... Nor was it entirely
occupied by the lowest class of people. ...... Julius Caesar is
said to have lived in a small house there, and in Martial’s
time, L. Armentius Stella, the friend of Statius! Burn, p.

79, 80.

10. consulis. Of. 1x. 42. 6 (addressed to Apollo), ‘Bis
senos cito te rogante fasces Det Stellae bonus annuatque Gaesar.’
