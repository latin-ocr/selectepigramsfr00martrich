ADDITIONS AND OORREOTIONS. 437

VII. 17. 9. Munro (Journal of Philology‚ ix. 219) explains
munere as abl. of cause (propter munus) qualifying cantaberis
and places delicata between commas as voc.

VII. 37. The Quaestor here was probably a quaestor pro
praetore attached to the Proconsul of a senatorial province.
These officials had a criminal jurisdiction of their own.

VII. 51. 13. noles, probably nolis should be read.

vm. 51. Friedl. understands a cup partly of electrum,
partly of gold and partly of silver‚ and rejects Lessing’s

explanations.

Vm. 78. 7. Linea, a cord to which presente were attached
which could be reached by jumping. Friedl.

IX. 71. Friedl. supposes that the ram was trained to
appear to eat lamb. But this does not explain rudis, nor the
fact that both were trained to eat food strange to them, which

is pretty obviously the sense of v. 7.

X. 19. 6. Orphea. The lacus Orphei seems to be meant, a
basin or reservoir of water of probably semi-circular form
Qaagzgszvsith a group representing Orpheus torn in pieces by

X. 48. 2. Friedl. adopts Mr Paley’s suggestion, ‘Et pilata
redit jam subiitque cohors ’‚ and understands it of the cohort

of praetorians on guard at the Palace going off duty and being
relieved by another.

XII. 3. 7. The Templum Divi Auyusti is apparently meant,

which was finished by Caligula. Tiberius had placed here the
library of Augustus. Friedl. supposes that Domitian had
removed the library and that Trajan had now restored it. See

Suet. Calig. 21, Tib. 74.
