NOTES. V. xlix. ll—li. 3. 289

1. 6, describes a magnificent entertainment at the saturnalia
of Aa). 90, in which handsome and splendidly dressed slaves,
as numerous as the spectators, handed round viands and wine.
Fruits of various kinds, especially dates, were commonly thrown
among the people on these occasions, cf. xr. 31. 10. For fuller
details, see Friedla'nder‚ 11. 285, foll.

11. Geryonem. The three-headed monster of the island
of Erytheia killed by Hercules·

12. censeo, parenthetic. So Cic. Cat. nr. 6, 13.

Philippi. The temple of Hercules, so named from one of
the statues in it, a statue of Hercules playing on the lyre,
was originally built in the Campus Flaminius by M. Fulvius
Nobilior, B.0. 187. It was restored and a portico added to
it by L. Marcius Philippus, stepfather of Augustus.

13. peristi. ‘You are a dead man.'

LI. On a causidicus, The satire is probably directed
against the man’s ill-conditioned haughtiness, in taking no
notice of those who saluted him in public. This great speaker,
says Martial‚ cannot say so much as ave in Latin, or χαῖρε
in Greek.

1. libellis, ‘documenta'

2. notariorum. A special class of librarii, that is, slaves
or freedmen employed in the study. The duties of the notarii
were to take notes, transcribe passages, cicc. In particular
they were shorthand writers, taking down speeches or poetic
effusions as fast as the speakers could utter them. Cf. XIV.
298, entitled Notarius.-

“ Currant verba licet, manus est velocior illis:
Nondum lingua suum, dextra peregit opus.’'

levis, apparently=imberbis‚ but what the force of the
epithet is here, it seems impossible to say.

3. codicillis, much the same as puyillares‚ 11. 6. 6.

codex was a collection of cerae, codicillus a collection of
small cerae. They were used for various purposes; sometimes,
as apparently here, by speakers to write the notes on from
which they spoke.

hinc et inde prolatis, ‘produced by one after another' of
the notarii, who would probably have written them from
dictation‚ lit. ⁶ produced from this side and ‘chat’
