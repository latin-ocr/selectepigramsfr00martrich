INTROD UCTION. ix

The value of the presents and the frequency of the
invitations would vary according to the popularity of
the client, and Martial was neither likely to receive
the least valuable presents‚ nor to be reduced often to
the necessity of ordering his own dinner²⁰. Taking,
then, all these things into consideration and even
assuming that he made nothing by the sale of his books
(see Ι. 2. 3), we can hardly believe that Martial's
poverty was so abject as his own statements would
lead us to suppose. His complaints os his poverty,
certainly, are incessant. He abuses the rich men of
Rome who allow poets to starve, while circus jockeys
and musicians roll in wealth. He advises parents to
make their sons auctioneers, musicians‚ anything rather
than bring them up to literary starvation²¹. WVhen he
leaves Rome for a season between the publication of
1115 second and third books he instructs his book to
say in reply to a supposed questioner, “Poeta exierat :
veniet cum citharoedus erit.'' He is never tired in
fact of making such complaints, Equally he is never
ashamed to ask for presents on the same score. Some-
times his requests are plaintive, sometimes impudent.
Sometimes he abuses his patrous for diminishing the
value of their presents year by year22. Sometimes he
offers them the refusal of their own presents which he
is obliged to sell to buy necessaries²³. The joyful
strains in which he celebrates the gift of a toga
from Parthenius are checked on an instant at the end
of the epigram by the mournful recollection of his old
lacerna. He cannot wear the beautiful new toga
without a lacerna to match. When the same toga is
worn out he deplores its decease in pathetic tones
