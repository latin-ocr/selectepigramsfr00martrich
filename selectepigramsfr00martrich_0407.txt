NOJ'ES. X. xxx. 1-15, 381

XXX. On the Formian villa of Apollinaris (IV. 86). It
was on the coast overlooking the sea; perhaps it was built in

the sea on piers, cf. vv, 17-19.
2. oppidum. Jocosely applied to Rome.
5. sanctae. ⁴ Blameless,’ cf. vn. 17. 3.

uxoris. The wife of Apollinaris apparently possessed a
villa of her own at Tibur.

6. Tusculum. Much frequented by the Romans (Horace,
ἓὲερε, 111. xxix. 8), as were all the places in Latium enumerated

Algido} Adj . of Algidum, the mountain in Latium. Horace,
111. xxm. .

7. Praeneste. Horace, Odes 111. iv. 23.

Antium. Where the famous temple of Fortune was. Horace.
Odes, 1. xxxv. 1.
8. circe. That is, Circeii. Cf. v. 1. 5.

Dardanis. Because founded by the Trojans, and named
after the nurse of Aeneas, Verg. Aen. vn. 1-2, Caieta was
a town, and harbour, about four miles from Formiae.

9. Marica. The goddess of the coast of Minturnae. Her
grove was in Minturnae, which was situated on the right bank
of the Liris, about three miles from the sea, and on the Appian
way. The neighbourhood was unhealthy‚ b'ut, owing to its
posit-ion, popular. Horace, Odes. 111. xvii. 7.

10. An obscure line. Probably, a place in the neigh-
bourhood of a spring, or fountain, of the same name as the
Carian Salmacis, is meant. The Italian Salmacis is, like the
Carian, represented as a nymph; but some local information
is wanting to explain the allusion satisfactorily. Vena, for
the waters of an open lake, is a strange use; possibly the canal
from Baiae to the Lucrine is meant. Some commentator-s un-
derstand the verse as expressing simply the voluptuous cha-
racter of the waters of the Lucrine.

12. viva quies. There is just sufficient breeze to prevent
a dead calm, but not enough to make a rough sea or swell.
Formiae was situated on the innermost point of the Sinus
Caietanus.

15. purpura, fan. Peacocks‘ tails were often used for the
purpose. xrv. 67, ‘Lambere quae turpes prohibet tua prandia
muscas, Alitis eximiae cauda superba fuit! The duty of fanning
their mistresses belonged to the pedissequae. Plautus speaks
of flabelliferae, Trin. 251, where see Wagner's note.
