seems really to be no ground for supposing that
Martial ever followed any other calling than that of
literature ¹⁰. From the year A.D. 86, five years after
the accession of Domitian, when Martia] published
the first and second books of his epigrams, we begin

possess in the Liber Spectaculorum), and so popular

collect, and keep in stock his juvenile pieces, of which
he himself had kept no record¹².

Titus. From this emperor he received the jus trium
