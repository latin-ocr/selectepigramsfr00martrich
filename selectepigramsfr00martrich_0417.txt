NOTES. X. lxii. 3—lxx. 391

mensae. Either a table at which the pupils sat when .
writing or doing suma, or the board on which the master
demonstrated. Marquardt v. i. 99.

4. calcu-lator. A teacher of arithmetic. Under the em-
pire boys were often sent to a special teacher for this branch 01
their education. Such a man taught arithmetie only.

notarius, perhaps another special teacher of short-hand
writing: cf. v. 51. 23 but it may possibly mean a writing
master simply.

8. cirrata, sc. scutica.

Scythae, adj.=Scythicae. Hides for leather making were
imported from Scythia, especially from Tanais, at the mouth
of the river of the same name. Strabo ΣΙ. ii. 3.

9. celaenaeus. He contended with Apollo in a trial of
’ musical skill at Celaenae in Phrygia.

10. ferinae, another instrument of corpor-al punishment.
It was used on the hands. It was the Greek νάρθηξ-ὼε
stalk of a tall umbelliferous plant—used by the Greeks for the
same purpose, among others, as that mentioned here. J ω’. 1.
15. On school holidays see v. 84. The long summer holiday‚
applied only apparently to country schools‚ when the boys
were required for agricultural purposes during the hot months.

LXV. Charmenion affects to see a great likeness between
himself and Martial, and addresses him as brother. Martial

resents the comparison.

1. corinthiorum. The most luxurious and effeminate
people in the Roman empire.

6. flexa. 111. 63. 3.

11. nobis, a very doubtful line. Fistula is a conjectura]
emendation for filia: with either nobis must be the dative, and
quam tu supplied after fortius. Prof. Conington supposed that
fistula, if the right reading, must mean the ‘windpipe‚’ in
which case fortius would be used absolutely—very nearly as a
positive degree. The emendation suggested by Aurelianus,
given in Schneidewin, edition 1, “non nobis least seems to give
a much better sense than the text. Friedlander would read
‘nobis ilia fortius loquentur.’ This has the advantage of
being nearest to the MSS. reading. It would imply‚ I suppose,
that Martia] could produce a voice as loud and louder than
Charmenion’s, with another organ quite remote from the wind-

pipe.
