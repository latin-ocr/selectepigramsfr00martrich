for an invitation. Gaston Boissier‚ 1. 367, 11. 212.

maesta iuvenca. Herod. 11. 41, τὸ ’γάρ τῆς Ἴσιος ἄγαλμα
ε’ὀν -γυναικήϊον βουκέρων ἐστιν, κάταπερ ’Έλληνες τὴν Ἰοῦν ’γρά-
φουσιν. For this, amongst other reasons, the Egyptian Isis
was confounded with the Greek Io, who was fabled, among
other wanderfflgs, to have visited Egypt and there to have
wedded Osiris. On the connexion between Egypt and Greece,
on which so many legends were founded, see Curtius, Hist. of
Greece, vol. 1.

9, 10. See Burn, R. and C. p. 317 et sqq. Three frag-
ments of the Capitoline plan (a plan of Rome in marble,
executed in the reign of Severus and discovered about the
middle of the 16th century) contain‚ one of them, the ground
plan of the cavea of Pompey's theatre; the other two, plans
of some parts of the annexed porticoes. On one of these the
last seven letters of the word Hecatosylum are found. We
may conclude, therefore, that the building alluded to in the
words centum pendentia tecta columnis formed a portion of the
buildings connected with the theatre of Pompey. ΜΓ. Burn
supposes that it was synonymous with Porticus Pompeii, but
illinc seems to imply that they were separate3 for dona nemus-
que duplex can hardly be anything but the Porticus Pompeii.
So also 111. 19. 1 we have ‘Proxima centenis ostenditur ursa
columnis, Exornant fictae qua platanona ferae) This porticus,
which adjoined the east side of the theatre, from which a door
in the centre of the scena led into the porticus, was divided
into three colonnades‚ two of which apparently (duplex) were
planted with plane trees and ornamented with figures of wild
animals, 111. 19. 2 quoted above. Cf. also Ovid, Art. Am. 1. 67.

These buildings stood on the boundary line between the
Campus Martius proper and the Campus Flaminia&

pendentia means simply ‘poised on.' Cf. Spect. 1. 5.

11. Fortunatus and Faustus, apparently keepers of inferior
baths. Those of Gryllus and Lupus certainly were so. The
former were dark and the latter, judging from the term aeoliam,
draughty. Cf. 1. 59. 3, ‘⁴ Redde Lupi nobis tenebrosaque balnea
Grylli Tam male cum coenem cur bene, F bacae, laver,’' addressed
to a host whose baths were excellent but his dinners bad.

13. ternis. If this is the true reading it must mean
apparently that he took three hot baths in each of the estab-
lishments, for fear of missing a single chance of an invitation.
