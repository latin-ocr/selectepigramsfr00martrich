The term Centurio primi pili dated from the earliest times, and

Maniple of Triarii, but it was retained after the distinction of
the lines had ceased‚ and meant the First Centurion of the
legion. This Centurion was an important officer‚ ranking next
to the Tribunos, and having a seat in the council of war. Like
the Tribuneship‚ this Centurionship also conferred equestrian
dignity on the holder.

only give once in the year, do not cost you a dirty black
copper to put on the table, and seven of us, your oldest friends,
you dine at the cost of a bad halfpenny.’
