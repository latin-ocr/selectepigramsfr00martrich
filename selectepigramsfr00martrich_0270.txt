244 NOTES. III. xxxvi. 6—xxxviii. 14.

6. Tm. The distance was considerable for a tired man—
over a mile. The whole subject of the payment at the baths is so
obscure that we cannot tell whether Martial used the baths of
Titus for economy's sake or not. It is of course easy to under-
stand that different men should prefer different baths, and, as
apparently some payment was made at all, it is very likely that
men contracted for a certain period instead of paying every
time.

7. triginta. If Martial is speaking of himself this epi-
gram must be later than the rest of the book, and inserted
afterwards, for he was only 35 years at Rome altogether, and
this book must have been published ten or eleven years before
he left Rome. But it is very likely that Martial here is imper-
sonating some other client of older standing than himself.

8. amicitiae seems to be used concretely like the Greek
συμμαχία. ‘ That I should be (treated as) a raw recruit in the
ranks of your friends.²

9. toga. 1. 108. 7, 11. 57. 5.

meaque. A hit at the patron for not having given him
more presents. Cf. 11. 46.

10. rudem. Spect. XXIX. 9.

XXXVIII. Το a friend who proposed to come to Rome to
make a livelihood as a causidicus, or a poet, οι· a courtier, dis-
couraging the idea.

3. causas. Of. ¹.¹· 64, 1.
4. in triplici foro, i.e. Romano, Augusti, Julii.

6. pensio. ⁴ They did not make the rent of their lodgings
out of it.’ Cf. 111. 30. 3.

11. ' A few favoured clients, e.g. literary men of celebrity
whose attendance flattered the vanity of the great men, made a
fair living by their clientship, but very feW, apparently.

14. sl bonus es. ‘ If you are a good man, as you are, you
may pick up a chance living somehow‚' πᾳραῖ προσδοκίαν. The
protasis would lead a reader to expect a suggestion as to how to
make a good livelihood.

casu. Cf. Seneca ΕΡ. 71, 3, Necesse est multum in vita
nostra casus possit, quia vivimus casu, i. e. without any fixed

plan or methodj anynow.
