NOTES. SPEOT. XXVIII. 1-8. 175

tempore interjecto (after the naumachia of lake Fucinus) altius
effossi specus et ...... yladiatorium spectaculum edidit inditis
pontibus ad pedestrem pit-qnam) But some of the expressions
in the epigram seem to make it clear that these exhibitions
took place actually in the water, and this view is confirmed by
a passage in Dio Cassius, 66, c. 25, 53, where speaking of Titus
he sayS, τὸ γὰρ θέατρον αὐτὸ ἐκεῖνο (i.e. the amphitheatre) ὕδατος
ἐξαίφνης πληρώσας ἐσήγαγε μὲν καὶ ἵππους καὶ ταύρους καὶ ἄλλα
τινὰ χειροήθη, δεδιδαγμένοι πάνθ’ ὅσα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς πράττειν καὶέν
τῳ υΎρῳ·

From line 9 it seems probable that the exhibition alluded
to by MartiaL though similar to those mentioned by Dio
Cassius l.c., took place on the lake of Domitian by the Tiber,
See Epig. xxw. Introduction. As to the marvellous extent to
which animals were tamed and trained at Rome see spect.
xvm. 1, xv1. b, v, 31, 1. 6, 14, 22. The trainers seem
to have taken a special pride in teaching animals to do
what was most contrary to their natural instincts, cf. 1. 104,
which gives a list of performances of trained animals, leopards
yoked, tigers submitting to the whip‚ stags and bears bridled
and bitted, boars led with halters, bisons drawing carts and
elephants dancing.

1. Augusti, cf. Spect. xmv. Introduction.

3. quota pars, ‘what a fragment was this of our Caesar-'s
work,’ cf. xxm. Introduction, ‘Carpophori portio!

4. Galatea, used for the Nereids generally.
ignotas, because they were land animab, cf. v. 11.

5. aequoreo pulvere, a very happy quasi-oxymoron‚ very
much in Martial's style, to express the spray caused by the
floating chariots: we must suppose that the chariots were
supported by bladders, or some artificial means.

5-8. Triton took for granted that it was Neptune's
chariot that he saw (Hom. Il. xm. 27, Verg. Aen. v. 817), and
Nereus preparing fierce naval warfare‚ was panio-stricken to
find himself turned into a landsman in the midst of the
waters.

ferventes, cf. Horace, Odes 1. i. 5, metaque fervidis evitata
rotis.

pedester, is here, as frequently, opposed to navalis. The
sights all around him made the god think that he must be on
land, although he was in liquidis undis.
