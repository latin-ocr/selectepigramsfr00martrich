1. summa pericula ludas. ‘ You play the most dangerous
games,’ i. e. where the risk of failure is as great as it can be.
Pericula is a cognate accusative.

2. non tamen. In this line, and in v. 10, Martial ex-
presses his admiration of the juggler's skill, by declaring that
it would require considerable effort on his part to fail.

3. nolentem, as well as securos, and neylecta (v, 7), keeps

XLIH. On a bronze statuette of Hercules, the work of
Lysippus. It belonged to Nonius Vindex, who possessed one
of the finest collections of antique works of art in Rome. See
Statius (Silvae, 1v. vi. 20-31), where he also describes this
statuette. It represented Hercules reclining at a banquet,
nec torva effigies epulisque aliena remissis, v. 50, with his
club in one hand and a cup in the other. Lysippus was a
Greek statuary, contemporary of Alexander. Hercules was his
favorite subject. See an account of his works in Smith’s Dict.
of Biography.
